Action was choppy throughout the day, as markets were able to shake off early trade jitters as Trump comments initially weighed on Apple AAPL.O AAPL.O and the tech sector .SPLRCT, while afternoon comments from White House adviser Kudlow buttressed indexes somewhat. Still, trade concerns ahead of the G20 meeting later this week lingered and weighed on industrials .SPLRCI as well as materials .SPLRCM. Materials were also dragged lower as a stronger dollar weighed on metals prices while United Tech UTX.N took a chunk out of industrials after it announced plans to split into three companies. The gains had a decidedly risk-off tone, with consumer staples .SPLRCS and utilities .SPLRCU among the leading sectors, a trend that could continue throughout the week.

(Full Story)The statement came on the heels of earlier comments that suggested a deal was unlikely. Markets are likely to remain volatile as headlines emerge ahead of the meeting.  (Full Story)Adding to the stew were comments from a host of Fed speakers, with Vice Chair Clarida still backing rate hikes while expressing caution as the central bank moves closer to a neutral stance.

(Click on chart below) This as trade tensions with China simmer.  (Full Story)Indeed, amid recent trade disputes, steel stocks have struggled. Despite the SLX advancing to multi-year highs earlier this year, action ultimately soured after President Trump first announced tariffs in early March. Highlighting the extent of the group's underperformance, the SLX is now down about 16 percent year-to-date. This while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY.P trades essentially flat. Of note, the SLX has exposure to both U.S. and foreign-based steel stocks. About 65 percent of the ETF's weighting was in foreign companies at the end of October vs. 35 percent in the U.S. As a group, the U.S. companies have outperformed the foreign companies this year with much of that rise coming in wake of the initial tariff announcement. That said, the ratio of the ETF's U.S./foreign holdings topped in early September, and has since stumbled.In any event, the SLX is trending down and appears on track to test its 200-WMA (now about $35.93). This just ahead of its May 2017 trough ($35.00). These levels are about 7-10 percent below the last price.(Terence Gabriel)*****                     STOCKS DRIFTING LOWER AFTER BRIEF MOVE GREEN (1244 EST/1744 GMT)Major indexes continue to drift downward after hitting a session high around 11 a.m. EST, but are well off session lows as Apple AAPL.O has pared initial declines from the open.

With the earnings season petering out, management issues, broker notes and M&A were the main drivers of the market.Renault RENA.PA was the top faller on the STOXX 600 after its CEO Carlos Ghosn, who is also chairman of the car maker's Japanese partner Nissan, was arrested in Japan on allegations of under-reporting his salary.  (Full Story)The dramatic fall for one of the best-known figures in the global car industry raised questions among investors about the future of the alliance, sending Renault shares down 9.4 percent to their lowest level since October 2014. Ghosn could not be reached for comment.""It is hard not to conclude that there may be a gulf opening up between Renault and Nissan,"" said Bernstein analyst Max Warburton, raising the prospect of a potential ""re-Japanization"" of Nissan and the end of the alliance.The fall, the biggest since Britain's vote in 2016 to leave the European Union, wiped about $2 billion off the company's market capitalisation. Tech stocks were the biggest sectoral fallers, down 2 to a 20-month closing low, with the sector hit by a slide in Apple  AAPL.O shares on concerns about iPhone demand.

Still, the U.S. government took in less money than it spent to begin the fiscal year, and the broader market reacted harshly. All three major averages sunk to session lows following the report as both the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 posted a green-to-red move, though have since eased back into positive territory.The Treasury Budget for October showed a deficit of $100.5 billion versus a deficit of $63.2 billion for the same period a year ago. The Treasury Budget data is not seasonally adjusted, so the October deficit cannot be compared to the $119.1 billion surplus for September.Total receipts of $252.7 billion were about 7.4% higher than a year ago while total outlays of $353.2 billion rose 18.3% compared to last year.The fiscal year-to-date deficit is $100.6 billion versus $63.3 billion at the same point in fiscal 2018.13:55 ETDow +16.34 at 25403.52, Nasdaq +44.42 at 7245.49, S&P +11.68 at 2738.04[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages haven't shifted much since our last update.Gold futures extended their recent losses on Tuesday, settling down 0.2% at $1,201.40/oz despite modest weakness in the dollar.The U.S. Dollar Index sits around 0.2% lower at 97.36.As a reminder, the October Treasury Budget is due out at the top of the hour.13:25 ETDow -34.34 at 25352.84, Nasdaq +41.47 at 7242.54, S&P +6.26 at 2732.62[BRIEFING.COM] The major U.S. indices trade mixed as the effects from early positive U.S.-China chatter wane.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Caterpillar (CAT 128.19, +3.19), Intel (INTC 47.56, +1.92), and American Express (AXP 107.69, +1.20) are outperforming. Caterpillar, which conducts business in China, has benefited from renewed trade discussions between the United States and China.

The trade-sensitive materials and industrial sectors are up 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively.High-growth technology stocks have staged a rebound effort, as the information technology sector is up 0.7%. Chip stocks, in particular, have recouped some losses from the prior session, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 1.9%.However, Apple (AAPL 193.70, -0.44, -0.2%) has fallen back into negative territory after showing some early resiliency after another one of its suppliers cut its guidance. Chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO 63.76, -0.4, -0.1%) cut its guidance due to ""recent demand changes for flagship smartphones.""Also, showing relative strength is the heavily-weighted financials sector with a gain of 1.0%. The sector is higher today without any specific news catalyst, but has provided a lending hand to offset weakness in the energy sector (-0.9%), which is down amid another drop in oil prices.WTI crude has extended its losing streak to a 12th straight session, and is currently down 4.6% to $57.16/bbl. Weighing on the commodity today is a report from OPEC, which cut its 2019 oil demand forecast for the fourth consecutive month.

The chip supplier cited ""recent demand changes for flagship smartphones"" for its decision. Apple's resiliency in the face of more bad news has possibly fostered a belief that the bad news has already been priced in and that Apple might be poised for a rebound from short-term oversold conditions.Overseas, major European indices closed mostly higher. Germany's DAX gained 1.3%, France's CAC gained 0.9%, and UK's FTSE was flat.11:30 ETDow +86.49 at 25473.67, Nasdaq +96.96 at 7298.03, S&P +22.86 at 2749.22[BRIEFING.COM] High-growth stocks lead the S&P 500 higher, as the benchmark index now sports a healthy gain of 0.8%.

The rout in the information technology sector (-3.5%) underpinned the benchmark index's retreat below its 200-day moving average (2762.39) and wiped out monthly gains for the tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite, which lost 2.8% on Monday.Also, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.3%, and the Russell 2000 lost 2.0%.The market decline was triggered by Apple supplier Lumentum (LITE 37.50, -18.45, -33.0%) cutting its guidance due to a large, unnamed customer requesting to reduce shipments of laser diodes for 3D sensing. It is widely assumed that Apple is the customer in question, as it accounted for 30% of LITE's fiscal 2018 net revenue and uses laser diodes for its iPhone Face ID technology. This marks the second Apple supplier in as many weeks to have issued guidance warnings.Chip stocks, subsequently, posted heavy losses, as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.4%. Unsurprisingly, Apple chip suppliers Qorvo (QRVO 63.80, -4.35, -6.4%), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 72.84, -3.82, -5.0%), and Cirrus Logic (CRUS 35.64, -5.74, -13.9%) underperformed.

Facebook (FB 141.55, -3.41, -2.4%), Alphabet (GOOG 1038.63, -27.52, -2.6%), and Netflix (NFLX 294.07, -9.40, -3.1%) weighed on the communication services (-1.5%) sector, and Amazon (AMZN 1636.85, -75.58, -4.1%) led the consumer discretionary sector (-2.3%) lower.Conversely, real estate (+0.2%) was the only sector to finish with gains on Monday. The utilities (unch) and consumer staples (-0.7%) sectors also showed relative strength.Of note, former Dow component General Electric's (GE 7.99, -0.59) struggles continued with a loss of 6.9%. CEO Larry Culp said the company's biggest priority is to bring down leverage levels and has plenty of opportunity to do that through asset sales. Also, Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS 206.05, -16.60) fell 7.5%. The investment management company is reportedly being pressed by Malaysia for a full refund of around $600 million over alleged fraudulent activity regarding the 1MDB investment fund Goldman Sachs set up for it.In energy, Saudi Arabia announced it will reduce its oil exports in December by 500,000 barrels a day due to a seasonal slowdown in demand. The world's largest oil exporter also thinks a 1 million barrel per day cut by oil producers from October production levels might be necessary. United States President Donald Trump, in turn, tweeted his opposition to OPEC's desire to cut oil production, saying that oil prices should be lower based on supply. President Trump's tweet dampened an early WTI crude rebound, which backpedaled 0.5% to settle at $59.84/bbl.Separately, the bond market was closed on Monday in observance of Veterans Day, and investors did not receive any notable economic data.Elsewhere, Asian markets added slim gains with China's Shanghai Index showing relative strength (+1.2%). China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA 142.82, -2.03) recorded the biggest online shopping day in history on Sunday after it tallied $30.8 billion in sales. Shares slipped 1.4% on Monday, though. In Europe, the major indices closed on a lower note with Germany's DAX (-1.9%) leading the retreat.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for October and the Treasury Budget for October on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +4.3% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average +2.7% YTD S&P 500 +2.0% YTD Russell 2000 -1.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 781/2136. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 684/2358.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants.  1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comCopyright (c) 2018 Comtex News Network, Inc.

Still, the U.S. government took in less money than it spent to begin the fiscal year, and the broader market reacted harshly. All three major averages sunk to session lows following the report as both the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 posted a green-to-red move, though have since eased back into positive territory.The Treasury Budget for October showed a deficit of $100.5 billion versus a deficit of $63.2 billion for the same period a year ago. The Treasury Budget data is not seasonally adjusted, so the October deficit cannot be compared to the $119.1 billion surplus for September.Total receipts of $252.7 billion were about 7.4% higher than a year ago while total outlays of $353.2 billion rose 18.3% compared to last year.The fiscal year-to-date deficit is $100.6 billion versus $63.3 billion at the same point in fiscal 2018.13:55 ETDow +16.34 at 25403.52, Nasdaq +44.42 at 7245.49, S&P +11.68 at 2738.04[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages haven't shifted much since our last update.Gold futures extended their recent losses on Tuesday, settling down 0.2% at $1,201.40/oz despite modest weakness in the dollar.The U.S. Dollar Index sits around 0.2% lower at 97.36.As a reminder, the October Treasury Budget is due out at the top of the hour.13:25 ETDow -34.34 at 25352.84, Nasdaq +41.47 at 7242.54, S&P +6.26 at 2732.62[BRIEFING.COM] The major U.S. indices trade mixed as the effects from early positive U.S.-China chatter wane.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Caterpillar (CAT 128.19, +3.19), Intel (INTC 47.56, +1.92), and American Express (AXP 107.69, +1.20) are outperforming.

The rout in the information technology sector (-3.5%) underpinned the benchmark index's retreat below its 200-day moving average (2762.39) and wiped out monthly gains for the tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite, which lost 2.8% on Monday.Also, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.3%, and the Russell 2000 lost 2.0%.The market decline was triggered by Apple supplier Lumentum (LITE 37.50, -18.45, -33.0%) cutting its guidance due to a large, unnamed customer requesting to reduce shipments of laser diodes for 3D sensing. It is widely assumed that Apple is the customer in question, as it accounted for 30% of LITE's fiscal 2018 net revenue and uses laser diodes for its iPhone Face ID technology. This marks the second Apple supplier in as many weeks to have issued guidance warnings.Chip stocks, subsequently, posted heavy losses, as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.4%. Unsurprisingly, Apple chip suppliers Qorvo (QRVO 63.80, -4.35, -6.4%), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 72.84, -3.82, -5.0%), and Cirrus Logic (CRUS 35.64, -5.74, -13.9%) underperformed. Meanwhile, notable chipmaker NVIDIA (NVDA 189.54, -16.13) erased yearly gains with a loss of 7.8%, and Advanced Micro (AMD 19.03, -2.00) lost 9.5%, though still sports a sizable yearly gain of 85.1%.The lack of investor confidence in growth stocks also manifested itself in the other FANG names. Facebook (FB 141.55, -3.41, -2.4%), Alphabet (GOOG 1038.63, -27.52, -2.6%), and Netflix (NFLX 294.07, -9.40, -3.1%) weighed on the communication services (-1.5%) sector, and Amazon (AMZN 1636.85, -75.58, -4.1%) led the consumer discretionary sector (-2.3%) lower.Conversely, real estate (+0.2%) was the only sector to finish with gains on Monday. The utilities (unch) and consumer staples (-0.7%) sectors also showed relative strength.Of note, former Dow component General Electric's (GE 7.99, -0.59) struggles continued with a loss of 6.9%. CEO Larry Culp said the company's biggest priority is to bring down leverage levels and has plenty of opportunity to do that through asset sales. Also, Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS 206.05, -16.60) fell 7.5%. The investment management company is reportedly being pressed by Malaysia for a full refund of around $600 million over alleged fraudulent activity regarding the 1MDB investment fund Goldman Sachs set up for it.In energy, Saudi Arabia announced it will reduce its oil exports in December by 500,000 barrels a day due to a seasonal slowdown in demand. The world's largest oil exporter also thinks a 1 million barrel per day cut by oil producers from October production levels might be necessary. United States President Donald Trump, in turn, tweeted his opposition to OPEC's desire to cut oil production, saying that oil prices should be lower based on supply. President Trump's tweet dampened an early WTI crude rebound, which backpedaled 0.5% to settle at $59.84/bbl.Separately, the bond market was closed on Monday in observance of Veterans Day, and investors did not receive any notable economic data.Elsewhere, Asian markets added slim gains with China's Shanghai Index showing relative strength (+1.2%). China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA 142.82, -2.03) recorded the biggest online shopping day in history on Sunday after it tallied $30.8 billion in sales. Shares slipped 1.4% on Monday, though. In Europe, the major indices closed on a lower note with Germany's DAX (-1.9%) leading the retreat.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for October and the Treasury Budget for October on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +4.3% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average +2.7% YTD S&P 500 +2.0% YTD Russell 2000 -1.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 781/2136. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 684/2358.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants.  1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comCopyright (c) 2018 Comtex News Network, Inc.

Still, the U.S. government took in less money than it spent to begin the fiscal year, and the broader market reacted harshly. All three major averages sunk to session lows following the report as both the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 posted a green-to-red move, though have since eased back into positive territory.The Treasury Budget for October showed a deficit of $100.5 billion versus a deficit of $63.2 billion for the same period a year ago. The Treasury Budget data is not seasonally adjusted, so the October deficit cannot be compared to the $119.1 billion surplus for September.Total receipts of $252.7 billion were about 7.4% higher than a year ago while total outlays of $353.2 billion rose 18.3% compared to last year.The fiscal year-to-date deficit is $100.6 billion versus $63.3 billion at the same point in fiscal 2018.13:55 ETDow +16.34 at 25403.52, Nasdaq +44.42 at 7245.49, S&P +11.68 at 2738.04[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages haven't shifted much since our last update.Gold futures extended their recent losses on Tuesday, settling down 0.2% at $1,201.40/oz despite modest weakness in the dollar.The U.S. Dollar Index sits around 0.2% lower at 97.36.As a reminder, the October Treasury Budget is due out at the top of the hour.13:25 ETDow -34.34 at 25352.84, Nasdaq +41.47 at 7242.54, S&P +6.26 at 2732.62[BRIEFING.COM] The major U.S. indices trade mixed as the effects from early positive U.S.-China chatter wane.A look inside the Dow Jones Industrial Average shows that Caterpillar (CAT 128.19, +3.19), Intel (INTC 47.56, +1.92), and American Express (AXP 107.69, +1.20) are outperforming. Caterpillar, which conducts business in China, has benefited from renewed trade discussions between the United States and China. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow believes the discussions to be ""very positive.""Conversely, Boeing (BA 350.66, -6.37) is the worst-performing Dow component as shares face pressure from the company reportedly withholding potential hazards on a new flight-control feature.The DJIA is currently down 2.4% this week.13:00 ETDow -24.01 at 25363.17, Nasdaq +40.71 at 7241.78, S&P +7.16 at 2733.52[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500 holds a gain of 0.3% in what has been a volatile session thus far.

Chip stocks, in particular, have recouped some losses from the prior session, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 1.9%.However, Apple (AAPL 193.70, -0.44, -0.2%) has fallen back into negative territory after showing some early resiliency after another one of its suppliers cut its guidance. Chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO 63.76, -0.4, -0.1%) cut its guidance due to ""recent demand changes for flagship smartphones.""Also, showing relative strength is the heavily-weighted financials sector with a gain of 1.0%. The sector is higher today without any specific news catalyst, but has provided a lending hand to offset weakness in the energy sector (-0.9%), which is down amid another drop in oil prices.WTI crude has extended its losing streak to a 12th straight session, and is currently down 4.6% to $57.16/bbl. Weighing on the commodity today is a report from OPEC, which cut its 2019 oil demand forecast for the fourth consecutive month.

The rout in the information technology sector (-3.5%) underpinned the benchmark index's retreat below its 200-day moving average (2762.39) and wiped out monthly gains for the tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite, which lost 2.8% on Monday.Also, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.3%, and the Russell 2000 lost 2.0%.The market decline was triggered by Apple supplier Lumentum (LITE 37.50, -18.45, -33.0%) cutting its guidance due to a large, unnamed customer requesting to reduce shipments of laser diodes for 3D sensing. It is widely assumed that Apple is the customer in question, as it accounted for 30% of LITE's fiscal 2018 net revenue and uses laser diodes for its iPhone Face ID technology. This marks the second Apple supplier in as many weeks to have issued guidance warnings.Chip stocks, subsequently, posted heavy losses, as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.4%. Unsurprisingly, Apple chip suppliers Qorvo (QRVO 63.80, -4.35, -6.4%), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 72.84, -3.82, -5.0%), and Cirrus Logic (CRUS 35.64, -5.74, -13.9%) underperformed.

Facebook (FB 141.55, -3.41, -2.4%), Alphabet (GOOG 1038.63, -27.52, -2.6%), and Netflix (NFLX 294.07, -9.40, -3.1%) weighed on the communication services (-1.5%) sector, and Amazon (AMZN 1636.85, -75.58, -4.1%) led the consumer discretionary sector (-2.3%) lower.Conversely, real estate (+0.2%) was the only sector to finish with gains on Monday. The utilities (unch) and consumer staples (-0.7%) sectors also showed relative strength.Of note, former Dow component General Electric's (GE 7.99, -0.59) struggles continued with a loss of 6.9%. CEO Larry Culp said the company's biggest priority is to bring down leverage levels and has plenty of opportunity to do that through asset sales. Also, Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS 206.05, -16.60) fell 7.5%. The investment management company is reportedly being pressed by Malaysia for a full refund of around $600 million over alleged fraudulent activity regarding the 1MDB investment fund Goldman Sachs set up for it.In energy, Saudi Arabia announced it will reduce its oil exports in December by 500,000 barrels a day due to a seasonal slowdown in demand. The world's largest oil exporter also thinks a 1 million barrel per day cut by oil producers from October production levels might be necessary. United States President Donald Trump, in turn, tweeted his opposition to OPEC's desire to cut oil production, saying that oil prices should be lower based on supply. President Trump's tweet dampened an early WTI crude rebound, which backpedaled 0.5% to settle at $59.84/bbl.Separately, the bond market was closed on Monday in observance of Veterans Day, and investors did not receive any notable economic data.Elsewhere, Asian markets added slim gains with China's Shanghai Index showing relative strength (+1.2%). China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA 142.82, -2.03) recorded the biggest online shopping day in history on Sunday after it tallied $30.8 billion in sales. Shares slipped 1.4% on Monday, though. In Europe, the major indices closed on a lower note with Germany's DAX (-1.9%) leading the retreat.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for October and the Treasury Budget for October on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +4.3% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average +2.7% YTD S&P 500 +2.0% YTD Russell 2000 -1.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 781/2136. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 684/2358.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants.  1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comCopyright (c) 2018 Comtex News Network, Inc.

The rout in the information technology sector (-3.5%) underpinned the benchmark index's retreat below its 200-day moving average (2762.39) and wiped out monthly gains for the tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite, which lost 2.8% on Monday.Also, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.3%, and the Russell 2000 lost 2.0%.The market decline was triggered by Apple supplier Lumentum (LITE 37.50, -18.45, -33.0%) cutting its guidance due to a large, unnamed customer requesting to reduce shipments of laser diodes for 3D sensing. It is widely assumed that Apple is the customer in question, as it accounted for 30% of LITE's fiscal 2018 net revenue and uses laser diodes for its iPhone Face ID technology. This marks the second Apple supplier in as many weeks to have issued guidance warnings.Chip stocks, subsequently, posted heavy losses, as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.4%. Unsurprisingly, Apple chip suppliers Qorvo (QRVO 63.80, -4.35, -6.4%), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 72.84, -3.82, -5.0%), and Cirrus Logic (CRUS 35.64, -5.74, -13.9%) underperformed.

Facebook (FB 141.55, -3.41, -2.4%), Alphabet (GOOG 1038.63, -27.52, -2.6%), and Netflix (NFLX 294.07, -9.40, -3.1%) weighed on the communication services (-1.5%) sector, and Amazon (AMZN 1636.85, -75.58, -4.1%) led the consumer discretionary sector (-2.3%) lower.Conversely, real estate (+0.2%) was the only sector to finish with gains on Monday. The utilities (unch) and consumer staples (-0.7%) sectors also showed relative strength.Of note, former Dow component General Electric's (GE 7.99, -0.59) struggles continued with a loss of 6.9%. CEO Larry Culp said the company's biggest priority is to bring down leverage levels and has plenty of opportunity to do that through asset sales. Also, Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS 206.05, -16.60) fell 7.5%. The investment management company is reportedly being pressed by Malaysia for a full refund of around $600 million over alleged fraudulent activity regarding the 1MDB investment fund Goldman Sachs set up for it.In energy, Saudi Arabia announced it will reduce its oil exports in December by 500,000 barrels a day due to a seasonal slowdown in demand. The world's largest oil exporter also thinks a 1 million barrel per day cut by oil producers from October production levels might be necessary. United States President Donald Trump, in turn, tweeted his opposition to OPEC's desire to cut oil production, saying that oil prices should be lower based on supply. President Trump's tweet dampened an early WTI crude rebound, which backpedaled 0.5% to settle at $59.84/bbl.Separately, the bond market was closed on Monday in observance of Veterans Day, and investors did not receive any notable economic data.Elsewhere, Asian markets added slim gains with China's Shanghai Index showing relative strength (+1.2%). China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA 142.82, -2.03) recorded the biggest online shopping day in history on Sunday after it tallied $30.8 billion in sales. Shares slipped 1.4% on Monday, though. In Europe, the major indices closed on a lower note with Germany's DAX (-1.9%) leading the retreat.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for October and the Treasury Budget for October on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +4.3% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average +2.7% YTD S&P 500 +2.0% YTD Russell 2000 -1.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 781/2136. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 684/2358.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants.  1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comCopyright (c) 2018 Comtex News Network, Inc.

Chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO 63.76, -0.4, -0.1%) cut its guidance due to ""recent demand changes for flagship smartphones.""Also, showing relative strength is the heavily-weighted financials sector with a gain of 1.0%. The sector is higher today without any specific news catalyst, but has provided a lending hand to offset weakness in the energy sector (-0.9%), which is down amid another drop in oil prices.WTI crude has extended its losing streak to a 12th straight session, and is currently down 4.6% to $57.16/bbl. Weighing on the commodity today is a report from OPEC, which cut its 2019 oil demand forecast for the fourth consecutive month.

The rout in the information technology sector (-3.5%) underpinned the benchmark index's retreat below its 200-day moving average (2762.39) and wiped out monthly gains for the tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite, which lost 2.8% on Monday.Also, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.3%, and the Russell 2000 lost 2.0%.The market decline was triggered by Apple supplier Lumentum (LITE 37.50, -18.45, -33.0%) cutting its guidance due to a large, unnamed customer requesting to reduce shipments of laser diodes for 3D sensing. It is widely assumed that Apple is the customer in question, as it accounted for 30% of LITE's fiscal 2018 net revenue and uses laser diodes for its iPhone Face ID technology. This marks the second Apple supplier in as many weeks to have issued guidance warnings.Chip stocks, subsequently, posted heavy losses, as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.4%. Unsurprisingly, Apple chip suppliers Qorvo (QRVO 63.80, -4.35, -6.4%), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 72.84, -3.82, -5.0%), and Cirrus Logic (CRUS 35.64, -5.74, -13.9%) underperformed.

Facebook (FB 141.55, -3.41, -2.4%), Alphabet (GOOG 1038.63, -27.52, -2.6%), and Netflix (NFLX 294.07, -9.40, -3.1%) weighed on the communication services (-1.5%) sector, and Amazon (AMZN 1636.85, -75.58, -4.1%) led the consumer discretionary sector (-2.3%) lower.Conversely, real estate (+0.2%) was the only sector to finish with gains on Monday. The utilities (unch) and consumer staples (-0.7%) sectors also showed relative strength.Of note, former Dow component General Electric's (GE 7.99, -0.59) struggles continued with a loss of 6.9%. CEO Larry Culp said the company's biggest priority is to bring down leverage levels and has plenty of opportunity to do that through asset sales. Also, Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS 206.05, -16.60) fell 7.5%. The investment management company is reportedly being pressed by Malaysia for a full refund of around $600 million over alleged fraudulent activity regarding the 1MDB investment fund Goldman Sachs set up for it.In energy, Saudi Arabia announced it will reduce its oil exports in December by 500,000 barrels a day due to a seasonal slowdown in demand. The world's largest oil exporter also thinks a 1 million barrel per day cut by oil producers from October production levels might be necessary. United States President Donald Trump, in turn, tweeted his opposition to OPEC's desire to cut oil production, saying that oil prices should be lower based on supply. President Trump's tweet dampened an early WTI crude rebound, which backpedaled 0.5% to settle at $59.84/bbl.Separately, the bond market was closed on Monday in observance of Veterans Day, and investors did not receive any notable economic data.Elsewhere, Asian markets added slim gains with China's Shanghai Index showing relative strength (+1.2%). China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA 142.82, -2.03) recorded the biggest online shopping day in history on Sunday after it tallied $30.8 billion in sales. Shares slipped 1.4% on Monday, though. In Europe, the major indices closed on a lower note with Germany's DAX (-1.9%) leading the retreat.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for October and the Treasury Budget for October on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +4.3% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average +2.7% YTD S&P 500 +2.0% YTD Russell 2000 -1.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 781/2136. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 684/2358.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants.  1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comCopyright (c) 2018 Comtex News Network, Inc.

The rout in the information technology sector (-3.5%) underpinned the benchmark index's retreat below its 200-day moving average (2762.39) and wiped out monthly gains for the tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite, which lost 2.8% on Monday.Also, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.3%, and the Russell 2000 lost 2.0%.The market decline was triggered by Apple supplier Lumentum (LITE 37.50, -18.45, -33.0%) cutting its guidance due to a large, unnamed customer requesting to reduce shipments of laser diodes for 3D sensing. It is widely assumed that Apple is the customer in question, as it accounted for 30% of LITE's fiscal 2018 net revenue and uses laser diodes for its iPhone Face ID technology. This marks the second Apple supplier in as many weeks to have issued guidance warnings.Chip stocks, subsequently, posted heavy losses, as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.4%. Unsurprisingly, Apple chip suppliers Qorvo (QRVO 63.80, -4.35, -6.4%), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 72.84, -3.82, -5.0%), and Cirrus Logic (CRUS 35.64, -5.74, -13.9%) underperformed.

Facebook (FB 141.55, -3.41, -2.4%), Alphabet (GOOG 1038.63, -27.52, -2.6%), and Netflix (NFLX 294.07, -9.40, -3.1%) weighed on the communication services (-1.5%) sector, and Amazon (AMZN 1636.85, -75.58, -4.1%) led the consumer discretionary sector (-2.3%) lower.Conversely, real estate (+0.2%) was the only sector to finish with gains on Monday. The utilities (unch) and consumer staples (-0.7%) sectors also showed relative strength.Of note, former Dow component General Electric's (GE 7.99, -0.59) struggles continued with a loss of 6.9%. CEO Larry Culp said the company's biggest priority is to bring down leverage levels and has plenty of opportunity to do that through asset sales. Also, Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS 206.05, -16.60) fell 7.5%. The investment management company is reportedly being pressed by Malaysia for a full refund of around $600 million over alleged fraudulent activity regarding the 1MDB investment fund Goldman Sachs set up for it.In energy, Saudi Arabia announced it will reduce its oil exports in December by 500,000 barrels a day due to a seasonal slowdown in demand. The world's largest oil exporter also thinks a 1 million barrel per day cut by oil producers from October production levels might be necessary. United States President Donald Trump, in turn, tweeted his opposition to OPEC's desire to cut oil production, saying that oil prices should be lower based on supply. President Trump's tweet dampened an early WTI crude rebound, which backpedaled 0.5% to settle at $59.84/bbl.Separately, the bond market was closed on Monday in observance of Veterans Day, and investors did not receive any notable economic data.Elsewhere, Asian markets added slim gains with China's Shanghai Index showing relative strength (+1.2%). China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA 142.82, -2.03) recorded the biggest online shopping day in history on Sunday after it tallied $30.8 billion in sales. Shares slipped 1.4% on Monday, though. In Europe, the major indices closed on a lower note with Germany's DAX (-1.9%) leading the retreat.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for October and the Treasury Budget for October on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +4.3% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average +2.7% YTD S&P 500 +2.0% YTD Russell 2000 -1.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 781/2136. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 684/2358.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants.  1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comCopyright (c) 2018 Comtex News Network, Inc.

The rout in the information technology sector (-3.5%) underpinned the benchmark index's retreat below its 200-day moving average (2762.39) and wiped out monthly gains for the tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite, which lost 2.8% on Monday.Also, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.3%, and the Russell 2000 lost 2.0%.The market decline was triggered by Apple supplier Lumentum (LITE 37.50, -18.45, -33.0%) cutting its guidance due to a large, unnamed customer requesting to reduce shipments of laser diodes for 3D sensing. It is widely assumed that Apple is the customer in question, as it accounted for 30% of LITE's fiscal 2018 net revenue and uses laser diodes for its iPhone Face ID technology. This marks the second Apple supplier in as many weeks to have issued guidance warnings.Chip stocks, subsequently, posted heavy losses, as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.4%. Unsurprisingly, Apple chip suppliers Qorvo (QRVO 63.80, -4.35, -6.4%), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 72.84, -3.82, -5.0%), and Cirrus Logic (CRUS 35.64, -5.74, -13.9%) underperformed. Meanwhile, notable chipmaker NVIDIA (NVDA 189.54, -16.13) erased yearly gains with a loss of 7.8%, and Advanced Micro (AMD 19.03, -2.00) lost 9.5%, though still sports a sizable yearly gain of 85.1%.The lack of investor confidence in growth stocks also manifested itself in the other FANG names. Facebook (FB 141.55, -3.41, -2.4%), Alphabet (GOOG 1038.63, -27.52, -2.6%), and Netflix (NFLX 294.07, -9.40, -3.1%) weighed on the communication services (-1.5%) sector, and Amazon (AMZN 1636.85, -75.58, -4.1%) led the consumer discretionary sector (-2.3%) lower.Conversely, real estate (+0.2%) was the only sector to finish with gains on Monday. The utilities (unch) and consumer staples (-0.7%) sectors also showed relative strength.Of note, former Dow component General Electric's (GE 7.99, -0.59) struggles continued with a loss of 6.9%. CEO Larry Culp said the company's biggest priority is to bring down leverage levels and has plenty of opportunity to do that through asset sales. Also, Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS 206.05, -16.60) fell 7.5%. The investment management company is reportedly being pressed by Malaysia for a full refund of around $600 million over alleged fraudulent activity regarding the 1MDB investment fund Goldman Sachs set up for it.In energy, Saudi Arabia announced it will reduce its oil exports in December by 500,000 barrels a day due to a seasonal slowdown in demand. The world's largest oil exporter also thinks a 1 million barrel per day cut by oil producers from October production levels might be necessary. United States President Donald Trump, in turn, tweeted his opposition to OPEC's desire to cut oil production, saying that oil prices should be lower based on supply. President Trump's tweet dampened an early WTI crude rebound, which backpedaled 0.5% to settle at $59.84/bbl.Separately, the bond market was closed on Monday in observance of Veterans Day, and investors did not receive any notable economic data.Elsewhere, Asian markets added slim gains with China's Shanghai Index showing relative strength (+1.2%). China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA 142.82, -2.03) recorded the biggest online shopping day in history on Sunday after it tallied $30.8 billion in sales. Shares slipped 1.4% on Monday, though. In Europe, the major indices closed on a lower note with Germany's DAX (-1.9%) leading the retreat.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for October and the Treasury Budget for October on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +4.3% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average +2.7% YTD S&P 500 +2.0% YTD Russell 2000 -1.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 781/2136. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 684/2358.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants.  1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comCopyright (c) 2018 Comtex News Network, Inc.

The chip supplier cited ""recent demand changes for flagship smartphones"" for its decision. Apple's resiliency in the face of more bad news has possibly fostered a belief that the bad news has already been priced in and that Apple might be poised for a rebound from short-term oversold conditions.Overseas, major European indices closed mostly higher.

The rout in the information technology sector (-3.5%) underpinned the benchmark index's retreat below its 200-day moving average (2762.39) and wiped out monthly gains for the tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite, which lost 2.8% on Monday.Also, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.3%, and the Russell 2000 lost 2.0%.The market decline was triggered by Apple supplier Lumentum (LITE 37.50, -18.45, -33.0%) cutting its guidance due to a large, unnamed customer requesting to reduce shipments of laser diodes for 3D sensing. It is widely assumed that Apple is the customer in question, as it accounted for 30% of LITE's fiscal 2018 net revenue and uses laser diodes for its iPhone Face ID technology. This marks the second Apple supplier in as many weeks to have issued guidance warnings.Chip stocks, subsequently, posted heavy losses, as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.4%. Unsurprisingly, Apple chip suppliers Qorvo (QRVO 63.80, -4.35, -6.4%), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 72.84, -3.82, -5.0%), and Cirrus Logic (CRUS 35.64, -5.74, -13.9%) underperformed. Meanwhile, notable chipmaker NVIDIA (NVDA 189.54, -16.13) erased yearly gains with a loss of 7.8%, and Advanced Micro (AMD 19.03, -2.00) lost 9.5%, though still sports a sizable yearly gain of 85.1%.The lack of investor confidence in growth stocks also manifested itself in the other FANG names. Facebook (FB 141.55, -3.41, -2.4%), Alphabet (GOOG 1038.63, -27.52, -2.6%), and Netflix (NFLX 294.07, -9.40, -3.1%) weighed on the communication services (-1.5%) sector, and Amazon (AMZN 1636.85, -75.58, -4.1%) led the consumer discretionary sector (-2.3%) lower.Conversely, real estate (+0.2%) was the only sector to finish with gains on Monday. The utilities (unch) and consumer staples (-0.7%) sectors also showed relative strength.Of note, former Dow component General Electric's (GE 7.99, -0.59) struggles continued with a loss of 6.9%. CEO Larry Culp said the company's biggest priority is to bring down leverage levels and has plenty of opportunity to do that through asset sales. Also, Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS 206.05, -16.60) fell 7.5%. The investment management company is reportedly being pressed by Malaysia for a full refund of around $600 million over alleged fraudulent activity regarding the 1MDB investment fund Goldman Sachs set up for it.In energy, Saudi Arabia announced it will reduce its oil exports in December by 500,000 barrels a day due to a seasonal slowdown in demand. The world's largest oil exporter also thinks a 1 million barrel per day cut by oil producers from October production levels might be necessary. United States President Donald Trump, in turn, tweeted his opposition to OPEC's desire to cut oil production, saying that oil prices should be lower based on supply. President Trump's tweet dampened an early WTI crude rebound, which backpedaled 0.5% to settle at $59.84/bbl.Separately, the bond market was closed on Monday in observance of Veterans Day, and investors did not receive any notable economic data.Elsewhere, Asian markets added slim gains with China's Shanghai Index showing relative strength (+1.2%). China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA 142.82, -2.03) recorded the biggest online shopping day in history on Sunday after it tallied $30.8 billion in sales. Shares slipped 1.4% on Monday, though. In Europe, the major indices closed on a lower note with Germany's DAX (-1.9%) leading the retreat.Looking ahead, investors will receive the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for October and the Treasury Budget for October on Tuesday.Nasdaq Composite +4.3% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average +2.7% YTD S&P 500 +2.0% YTD Russell 2000 -1.1% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 781/2136. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 684/2358.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants.  1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comCopyright (c) 2018 Comtex News Network, Inc.

It is widely assumed that Apple is the customer in question, as it accounted for 30% of LITE's fiscal 2018 net revenue and uses laser diodes for its iPhone Face ID technology. This marks the second Apple supplier in as many weeks to have issued guidance warnings.Chip stocks, subsequently, posted heavy losses, as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.4%.

CEO Larry Culp said the company's biggest priority is to bring down leverage levels and has plenty of opportunity to do that through asset sales. Also, Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS 206.05, -16.60) fell 7.5%. The investment management company is reportedly being pressed by Malaysia for a full refund of around $600 million over alleged fraudulent activity regarding the 1MDB investment fund Goldman Sachs set up for it.In energy, Saudi Arabia announced it will reduce its oil exports in December by 500,000 barrels a day due to a seasonal slowdown in demand.

United States President Donald Trump, in turn, tweeted his opposition to OPEC's desire to cut oil production, saying that oil prices should be lower based on supply.

The rout in the information technology sector (-3.5%) underpinned the benchmark index's retreat below its 200-day moving average (2762.39) and wiped out monthly gains for the tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite, which lost 2.8% on Monday.Also, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.3%, and the Russell 2000 lost 2.0%.The market decline was triggered by Apple supplier Lumentum (LITE 37.50, -18.45, -33.0%) cutting its guidance due to a large, unnamed customer requesting to reduce shipments of laser diodes for 3D sensing.

The utilities (unch) and consumer staples (-0.7%) sectors also showed relative strength.Of note, former Dow component General Electric's (GE 7.99, -0.59) struggles continued with a loss of 6.9%.

The rout in the information technology sector (-3.5%) underpinned the benchmark index's retreat below its 200-day moving average (2762.39) and wiped out monthly gains for the tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite, which lost 2.8% on Monday.Also, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.3%, and the Russell 2000 lost 2.0%.The market decline was triggered by Apple supplier Lumentum (LITE 37.50, -18.45, -33.0%) cutting its guidance due to a large, unnamed customer requesting to reduce shipments of laser diodes for 3D sensing. It is widely assumed that Apple is the customer in question, as it accounted for 30% of LITE's fiscal 2018 net revenue and uses laser diodes for its iPhone Face ID technology. This marks the second Apple supplier in as many weeks to have issued guidance warnings.Chip stocks, subsequently, posted heavy losses, as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.4%. Unsurprisingly, Apple chip suppliers Qorvo (QRVO 63.80, -4.35, -6.4%), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 72.84, -3.82, -5.0%), and Cirrus Logic (CRUS 35.64, -5.74, -13.9%) underperformed.

CEO Larry Culp said the company's biggest priority is to bring down leverage levels and has plenty of opportunity to do that through asset sales. Also, Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS 206.05, -16.60) fell 7.5%.

United States President Donald Trump, in turn, tweeted his opposition to OPEC's desire to cut oil production, saying that oil prices should be lower based on supply.

For the week, the S&P 500 advanced 2.1%.Outperforming the broader market on Friday were the defensive-oriented consumer staples (+0.5%), real estate (+0.1%), and utilities (+0.1%) sectors. Conversely, FANG stocks within the lagging communication services (-1.5%), consumer discretionary (-1.5%), and information technology (-1.7%) sectors underperformed.

Its guidance has extended a trend within the semiconductor industry that has warned of slowing chip demand. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index lost 1.9%.In other corporate news, Walt Disney (DIS 118.00, +2.00, +1.7%) rose after an upbeat earnings report, while General Electric (GE 8.58, -0.52, -5.7%) took a hit after JPMorgan cut its price target on the stock to $6 from $10. In response, the former Dow component responded that it is a ""fundamentally strong company with a sound liquidity position,"" according to a CNBC report.Demand for Treasuries increased amid the equity setback, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield lost four basis points to 2.93%, and the 10-yr yield lost five basis points to 3.19%. For the week, the 2-yr yield added two basis points, while the 10-yr yield shed two basis points.Separately, WTI crude, which is the U.S. benchmark for oil, fell 0.9% to settle at $60.16/bbl. Friday's loss has extended its decline to 21.8% from its Oct 3 four-year high. On a related note, the oil-sensitive energy sector lost 0.4% on Friday.In economic data, the Producer Price Index (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) for October was released on Friday morning, showing a higher-than-expected increase of 0.6%. The core reading, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy, also came in above consensus (+0.5% actual vs +0.2% Briefing.com consensus). The headline pressures stoked concerns about pass-through inflation to consumers and, in turn, helped to strengthen the Fed's case for additional rate hikes.In trade news, White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro made some combative comments against CEOs for pushing President Trump to make a trade deal with China and stated a trade deal will be on the president's terms. Separately, President Trump has reportedly been telling associates that he wants to replace Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross by the end of the year.Overseas, China reported just a 0.2% rise in its Consumer Price Index on Friday, which was in-line with estimates but significantly below last month's increase of 0.7%. Its softening inflation has continued to fuel concerns over a slowing Chinese economy.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for October, the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for November, and the Wholesale Inventories report for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand jumped 0.6% in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, less food and energy, rose 0.5% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). Those increases left the index for final demand up 2.9% year-over-year, versus 2.6% in September, and the index for final demand, less food and energy, up 2.6% year-over-year, versus 2.5% in September. The key takeaway from the report is that it will stoke concerns about pass-through inflation to the consumer, which have already been stoked by numerous companies during the third quarter earnings-reporting period talking about higher input costs and increasing prices. The preliminary University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for November held quite steady, edging down to 98.3 (Briefing.com consensus 98.0) from the final reading of 98.6 for October. The key takeaway from the report is that stock market sell-off in October had no real impact on consumer sentiment, which was rooted more in favorable views about income expectations and job growth that are key drivers of consumer spending. Wholesale inventories increased 0.4% in September (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) on top of a downwardly revised 0.9% increase (from 1.0%) in August. The key takeaway from the report is that sales are increasing year-over-year at a faster rate than inventories, which can be a precursor to improved pricing power for wholesalers.Looking ahead, investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +7.3% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average +5.1% YTD S&P 500 +4.0% YTD Russell 2000 +0.9% YTDWeek in Review: Fed Policy Statement Not Enough to Derail U.S. Midterm GainsThe S&P 500 rose 2.1% this week, but had to weather a late week sell-off after the latest policy statement from the Federal Reserve humbled an upbeat reaction to the midterm elections. Neither outcome was a surprise, but they were representative of recent market volatility. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite also finished the week higher, adding 2.8% and 0.7%, respectively. The Russell 2000 added 0.1%.The midterm elections produced a split Congress with the Democrats taking control of the House and the Republicans retaining control of the Senate. The prevailing assumption in the market was that a newly divided Congress would preserve market-friendly policies, namely the tax cut and deregulation efforts. In addition, investors took delight in the fact that the stock market has historically done well in years with a Republican president and split Congress.The Fed released its policy statement on Thursday, in which it decided to leave the fed funds rate unchanged as expected. The central bank noted that it expects further rate hikes that are consistent with sustained economic growth, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near its symmetric 2% target over the medium term, but omitted October's sell-off and U.S.-China trade developments from its policy statement. Those omissions were a clear, between-the-lines message that the FOMC remains poised to raise rates for a fourth time this year in December.In the stock market, the health care (+4.0%), real estate (+3.6%), and utility (+3.1%) groups led the way. Of note, health care has surpassed the information technology (+1.4%) and consumer discretionary (+2.0%) sectors for the top spot in the yearly sector standings with a 2018 gain of 12.4%. For comparison, tech is up 10.7%, and consumer discretionary is up 10.9%.Conversely, the communication services sector was the only group to finish in negative territory with a weekly loss of 0.2%.In earnings, some notable companies that had upbeat reports included Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), CVS (CVS), Eli Lilly (LLY), Humana (HUM), and Walt Disney (DIS). On the other hand, Skyworks Solution (SWKS) led chip stocks lower on Friday after it issued below-consensus Q1 earnings and revenue guidance. Skyworks, which is an Apple (AAPL) supplier, warned of slowing chip demand, continuing a disappointing trend out of the semiconductor industry.On a related note, Japan's Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple decided to cancel a production increase in its newest low-end iPhone XR. However, the Nikkei also said that demand for the older generation iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus has been higher than expected. Nevertheless, the report corroborated fears over the company reaching peak iPhone sales.In politics, Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned his post effective immediately per President Trump's request. Pot stocks initially surged in response to his resignation, as his adamant anti-marijuana stance has been seen as a roadblock to advancing the national discussion for legalization. However, pot stocks pulled back as replacement names currently being floated are against marijuana legalization; acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker has a mixed record on the issue.Looking at other markets, U.S. Treasuries had a volatile week, and closed near last week's levels. This week, the 2-yr yield decreased two basis points to 2.91%, and the 10-yr yield added two basis points to 3.21%.Also of note, WTI crude lost 4.8% this week, entering bear market territory and extending its decline from last month's four-year high. U.S. President Donald Trump granted temporary wavers on Monday to eight countries who import oil from Iran after the U.S.'s energy sanctions on the OPEC member were officially reimposed.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants.  1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comCopyright (c) 2018 Comtex News Network, Inc.

Separately, Bloomberg reported that Saudi Arabia also thinks a 1 million barrel per day cut by oil producers from October production levels might be necessary.

On a related note, the oil-sensitive energy sector lost 0.4% on Friday.In economic data, the Producer Price Index (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) for October was released on Friday morning, showing a higher-than-expected increase of 0.6%. The core reading, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy, also came in above consensus (+0.5% actual vs +0.2% Briefing.com consensus). The headline pressures stoked concerns about pass-through inflation to consumers and, in turn, helped to strengthen the Fed's case for additional rate hikes.In trade news, White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro made some combative comments against CEOs for pushing President Trump to make a trade deal with China and stated a trade deal will be on the president's terms. Separately, President Trump has reportedly been telling associates that he wants to replace Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross by the end of the year.Overseas, China reported just a 0.2% rise in its Consumer Price Index on Friday, which was in-line with estimates but significantly below last month's increase of 0.7%. Its softening inflation has continued to fuel concerns over a slowing Chinese economy.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for October, the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for November, and the Wholesale Inventories report for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand jumped 0.6% in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, less food and energy, rose 0.5% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). Those increases left the index for final demand up 2.9% year-over-year, versus 2.6% in September, and the index for final demand, less food and energy, up 2.6% year-over-year, versus 2.5% in September. The key takeaway from the report is that it will stoke concerns about pass-through inflation to the consumer, which have already been stoked by numerous companies during the third quarter earnings-reporting period talking about higher input costs and increasing prices. The preliminary University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for November held quite steady, edging down to 98.3 (Briefing.com consensus 98.0) from the final reading of 98.6 for October. The key takeaway from the report is that stock market sell-off in October had no real impact on consumer sentiment, which was rooted more in favorable views about income expectations and job growth that are key drivers of consumer spending. Wholesale inventories increased 0.4% in September (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) on top of a downwardly revised 0.9% increase (from 1.0%) in August. The key takeaway from the report is that sales are increasing year-over-year at a faster rate than inventories, which can be a precursor to improved pricing power for wholesalers.Looking ahead, investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +7.3% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average +5.1% YTD S&P 500 +4.0% YTD Russell 2000 +0.9% YTDWeek in Review: Fed Policy Statement Not Enough to Derail U.S. Midterm GainsThe S&P 500 rose 2.1% this week, but had to weather a late week sell-off after the latest policy statement from the Federal Reserve humbled an upbeat reaction to the midterm elections.

The central bank noted that it expects further rate hikes that are consistent with sustained economic growth, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near its symmetric 2% target over the medium term, but omitted October's sell-off and U.S.-China trade developments from its policy statement. Those omissions were a clear, between-the-lines message that the FOMC remains poised to raise rates for a fourth time this year in December.In the stock market, the health care (+4.0%), real estate (+3.6%), and utility (+3.1%) groups led the way. Of note, health care has surpassed the information technology (+1.4%) and consumer discretionary (+2.0%) sectors for the top spot in the yearly sector standings with a 2018 gain of 12.4%.

However, the Nikkei also said that demand for the older generation iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus has been higher than expected. Nevertheless, the report corroborated fears over the company reaching peak iPhone sales.In politics, Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned his post effective immediately per President Trump's request. Pot stocks initially surged in response to his resignation, as his adamant anti-marijuana stance has been seen as a roadblock to advancing the national discussion for legalization.

This week, the 2-yr yield decreased two basis points to 2.91%, and the 10-yr yield added two basis points to 3.21%.Also of note, WTI crude lost 4.8% this week, entering bear market territory and extending its decline from last month's four-year high.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.7%, and the Russell 2000 lost 1.8%. For the week, the S&P 500 advanced 2.1%.Outperforming the broader market on Friday were the defensive-oriented consumer staples (+0.5%), real estate (+0.1%), and utilities (+0.1%) sectors. Conversely, FANG stocks within the lagging communication services (-1.5%), consumer discretionary (-1.5%), and information technology (-1.7%) sectors underperformed. Netflix led the FANG group lower with a loss of 4.6%. Apple (AAPL 204.47, -4.02), Amazon (AMZN 1712.43, -42.48), Alphabet (GOOG 1066.15, -16.25), and Facebook (FB 144.96, -2.91) bared losses between 1.5% and 2.4%.Chip stocks dragged on the lagging tech sector, as key Apple supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 766.66, -6.74) fell 8.1% after it issued below-consensus top and bottom line guidance for its fiscal first quarter. Its guidance has extended a trend within the semiconductor industry that has warned of slowing chip demand. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index lost 1.9%.In other corporate news, Walt Disney (DIS 118.00, +2.00, +1.7%) rose after an upbeat earnings report, while General Electric (GE 8.58, -0.52, -5.7%) took a hit after JPMorgan cut its price target on the stock to $6 from $10. In response, the former Dow component responded that it is a ""fundamentally strong company with a sound liquidity position,"" according to a CNBC report.Demand for Treasuries increased amid the equity setback, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield lost four basis points to 2.93%, and the 10-yr yield lost five basis points to 3.19%. For the week, the 2-yr yield added two basis points, while the 10-yr yield shed two basis points.Separately, WTI crude, which is the U.S. benchmark for oil, fell 0.9% to settle at $60.16/bbl. Friday's loss has extended its decline to 21.8% from its Oct 3 four-year high. On a related note, the oil-sensitive energy sector lost 0.4% on Friday.In economic data, the Producer Price Index (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) for October was released on Friday morning, showing a higher-than-expected increase of 0.6%. The core reading, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy, also came in above consensus (+0.5% actual vs +0.2% Briefing.com consensus). The headline pressures stoked concerns about pass-through inflation to consumers and, in turn, helped to strengthen the Fed's case for additional rate hikes.In trade news, White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro made some combative comments against CEOs for pushing President Trump to make a trade deal with China and stated a trade deal will be on the president's terms. Separately, President Trump has reportedly been telling associates that he wants to replace Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross by the end of the year.Overseas, China reported just a 0.2% rise in its Consumer Price Index on Friday, which was in-line with estimates but significantly below last month's increase of 0.7%. Its softening inflation has continued to fuel concerns over a slowing Chinese economy.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for October, the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for November, and the Wholesale Inventories report for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand jumped 0.6% in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, less food and energy, rose 0.5% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). Those increases left the index for final demand up 2.9% year-over-year, versus 2.6% in September, and the index for final demand, less food and energy, up 2.6% year-over-year, versus 2.5% in September. The key takeaway from the report is that it will stoke concerns about pass-through inflation to the consumer, which have already been stoked by numerous companies during the third quarter earnings-reporting period talking about higher input costs and increasing prices. The preliminary University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for November held quite steady, edging down to 98.3 (Briefing.com consensus 98.0) from the final reading of 98.6 for October. The key takeaway from the report is that stock market sell-off in October had no real impact on consumer sentiment, which was rooted more in favorable views about income expectations and job growth that are key drivers of consumer spending. Wholesale inventories increased 0.4% in September (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) on top of a downwardly revised 0.9% increase (from 1.0%) in August. The key takeaway from the report is that sales are increasing year-over-year at a faster rate than inventories, which can be a precursor to improved pricing power for wholesalers.Looking ahead, investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +7.3% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average +5.1% YTD S&P 500 +4.0% YTD Russell 2000 +0.9% YTDWeek in Review: Fed Policy Statement Not Enough to Derail U.S. Midterm GainsThe S&P 500 rose 2.1% this week, but had to weather a late week sell-off after the latest policy statement from the Federal Reserve humbled an upbeat reaction to the midterm elections. Neither outcome was a surprise, but they were representative of recent market volatility. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite also finished the week higher, adding 2.8% and 0.7%, respectively. The Russell 2000 added 0.1%.The midterm elections produced a split Congress with the Democrats taking control of the House and the Republicans retaining control of the Senate. The prevailing assumption in the market was that a newly divided Congress would preserve market-friendly policies, namely the tax cut and deregulation efforts. In addition, investors took delight in the fact that the stock market has historically done well in years with a Republican president and split Congress.The Fed released its policy statement on Thursday, in which it decided to leave the fed funds rate unchanged as expected. The central bank noted that it expects further rate hikes that are consistent with sustained economic growth, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near its symmetric 2% target over the medium term, but omitted October's sell-off and U.S.-China trade developments from its policy statement. Those omissions were a clear, between-the-lines message that the FOMC remains poised to raise rates for a fourth time this year in December.In the stock market, the health care (+4.0%), real estate (+3.6%), and utility (+3.1%) groups led the way. Of note, health care has surpassed the information technology (+1.4%) and consumer discretionary (+2.0%) sectors for the top spot in the yearly sector standings with a 2018 gain of 12.4%. For comparison, tech is up 10.7%, and consumer discretionary is up 10.9%.Conversely, the communication services sector was the only group to finish in negative territory with a weekly loss of 0.2%.In earnings, some notable companies that had upbeat reports included Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), CVS (CVS), Eli Lilly (LLY), Humana (HUM), and Walt Disney (DIS). On the other hand, Skyworks Solution (SWKS) led chip stocks lower on Friday after it issued below-consensus Q1 earnings and revenue guidance. Skyworks, which is an Apple (AAPL) supplier, warned of slowing chip demand, continuing a disappointing trend out of the semiconductor industry.On a related note, Japan's Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple decided to cancel a production increase in its newest low-end iPhone XR. However, the Nikkei also said that demand for the older generation iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus has been higher than expected. Nevertheless, the report corroborated fears over the company reaching peak iPhone sales.In politics, Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned his post effective immediately per President Trump's request. Pot stocks initially surged in response to his resignation, as his adamant anti-marijuana stance has been seen as a roadblock to advancing the national discussion for legalization. However, pot stocks pulled back as replacement names currently being floated are against marijuana legalization; acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker has a mixed record on the issue.Looking at other markets, U.S. Treasuries had a volatile week, and closed near last week's levels. This week, the 2-yr yield decreased two basis points to 2.91%, and the 10-yr yield added two basis points to 3.21%.Also of note, WTI crude lost 4.8% this week, entering bear market territory and extending its decline from last month's four-year high. U.S. President Donald Trump granted temporary wavers on Monday to eight countries who import oil from Iran after the U.S.'s energy sanctions on the OPEC member were officially reimposed.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants.  1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comCopyright (c) 2018 Comtex News Network, Inc.

The three companies are trading at 52-week highs, according to FactSet.Conversely, Apple (AAPL 195.74, -8.74) is the worst-performing Dow component after investors have presumed it to be the unnamed company in Lumentum's (LITE 39.44, -16.43) statement regarding its guidance cut.

Of note, the benchmark index has fallen back below its 200-day moving average (2762.48) after spending three days above the key technical level.Meanwhile, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.7%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down 2.2%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 is down 1.1%.Apple supplier Lumentum (LITE, 42.04, -13.92, -24.9%) cut its guidance this morning, noting, ""We recently received a request from one of our largest Industrial and Consumer customers for laser diodes for 3D sensing to materially reduce shipments to them during our fiscal second quarter."" Investors have presumed the unnamed customer to be Apple, as Apple accounted for 30% of LITE's fiscal 2018 net revenue and Lumentum's 3D sensing lasers are key components for the iPhone's Face ID technology.Consequently, weakness has trickled down to chip stocks, as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index bares a loss of 3.7%. Some Apple chip suppliers that are down include Qorvo (QRVO 63.97, -4.18, -6.1%), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS 73.24, -3.42, -4.5%), and Cirrus Logic (CRUS 36.24, -5.13, -12.6%).

Its guidance has extended a trend within the semiconductor industry that has warned of slowing chip demand. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index lost 1.9%.In other corporate news, Walt Disney (DIS 118.00, +2.00, +1.7%) rose after an upbeat earnings report, while General Electric (GE 8.58, -0.52, -5.7%) took a hit after JPMorgan cut its price target on the stock to $6 from $10. In response, the former Dow component responded that it is a ""fundamentally strong company with a sound liquidity position,"" according to a CNBC report.Demand for Treasuries increased amid the equity setback, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield lost four basis points to 2.93%, and the 10-yr yield lost five basis points to 3.19%. For the week, the 2-yr yield added two basis points, while the 10-yr yield shed two basis points.Separately, WTI crude, which is the U.S. benchmark for oil, fell 0.9% to settle at $60.16/bbl.

On a related note, the oil-sensitive energy sector lost 0.4% on Friday.In economic data, the Producer Price Index (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) for October was released on Friday morning, showing a higher-than-expected increase of 0.6%. The core reading, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy, also came in above consensus (+0.5% actual vs +0.2% Briefing.com consensus). The headline pressures stoked concerns about pass-through inflation to consumers and, in turn, helped to strengthen the Fed's case for additional rate hikes.In trade news, White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro made some combative comments against CEOs for pushing President Trump to make a trade deal with China and stated a trade deal will be on the president's terms. Separately, President Trump has reportedly been telling associates that he wants to replace Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross by the end of the year.Overseas, China reported just a 0.2% rise in its Consumer Price Index on Friday, which was in-line with estimates but significantly below last month's increase of 0.7%. Its softening inflation has continued to fuel concerns over a slowing Chinese economy.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for October, the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for November, and the Wholesale Inventories report for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand jumped 0.6% in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, less food and energy, rose 0.5% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). Those increases left the index for final demand up 2.9% year-over-year, versus 2.6% in September, and the index for final demand, less food and energy, up 2.6% year-over-year, versus 2.5% in September. The key takeaway from the report is that it will stoke concerns about pass-through inflation to the consumer, which have already been stoked by numerous companies during the third quarter earnings-reporting period talking about higher input costs and increasing prices. The preliminary University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for November held quite steady, edging down to 98.3 (Briefing.com consensus 98.0) from the final reading of 98.6 for October. The key takeaway from the report is that stock market sell-off in October had no real impact on consumer sentiment, which was rooted more in favorable views about income expectations and job growth that are key drivers of consumer spending. Wholesale inventories increased 0.4% in September (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) on top of a downwardly revised 0.9% increase (from 1.0%) in August. The key takeaway from the report is that sales are increasing year-over-year at a faster rate than inventories, which can be a precursor to improved pricing power for wholesalers.Looking ahead, investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +7.3% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average +5.1% YTD S&P 500 +4.0% YTD Russell 2000 +0.9% YTDWeek in Review: Fed Policy Statement Not Enough to Derail U.S. Midterm GainsThe S&P 500 rose 2.1% this week, but had to weather a late week sell-off after the latest policy statement from the Federal Reserve humbled an upbeat reaction to the midterm elections. Neither outcome was a surprise, but they were representative of recent market volatility. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite also finished the week higher, adding 2.8% and 0.7%, respectively. The Russell 2000 added 0.1%.The midterm elections produced a split Congress with the Democrats taking control of the House and the Republicans retaining control of the Senate. The prevailing assumption in the market was that a newly divided Congress would preserve market-friendly policies, namely the tax cut and deregulation efforts. In addition, investors took delight in the fact that the stock market has historically done well in years with a Republican president and split Congress.The Fed released its policy statement on Thursday, in which it decided to leave the fed funds rate unchanged as expected. The central bank noted that it expects further rate hikes that are consistent with sustained economic growth, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near its symmetric 2% target over the medium term, but omitted October's sell-off and U.S.-China trade developments from its policy statement. Those omissions were a clear, between-the-lines message that the FOMC remains poised to raise rates for a fourth time this year in December.In the stock market, the health care (+4.0%), real estate (+3.6%), and utility (+3.1%) groups led the way. Of note, health care has surpassed the information technology (+1.4%) and consumer discretionary (+2.0%) sectors for the top spot in the yearly sector standings with a 2018 gain of 12.4%. For comparison, tech is up 10.7%, and consumer discretionary is up 10.9%.Conversely, the communication services sector was the only group to finish in negative territory with a weekly loss of 0.2%.In earnings, some notable companies that had upbeat reports included Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), CVS (CVS), Eli Lilly (LLY), Humana (HUM), and Walt Disney (DIS). On the other hand, Skyworks Solution (SWKS) led chip stocks lower on Friday after it issued below-consensus Q1 earnings and revenue guidance. Skyworks, which is an Apple (AAPL) supplier, warned of slowing chip demand, continuing a disappointing trend out of the semiconductor industry.On a related note, Japan's Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple decided to cancel a production increase in its newest low-end iPhone XR. However, the Nikkei also said that demand for the older generation iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus has been higher than expected. Nevertheless, the report corroborated fears over the company reaching peak iPhone sales.In politics, Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned his post effective immediately per President Trump's request. Pot stocks initially surged in response to his resignation, as his adamant anti-marijuana stance has been seen as a roadblock to advancing the national discussion for legalization. However, pot stocks pulled back as replacement names currently being floated are against marijuana legalization; acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker has a mixed record on the issue.Looking at other markets, U.S. Treasuries had a volatile week, and closed near last week's levels. This week, the 2-yr yield decreased two basis points to 2.91%, and the 10-yr yield added two basis points to 3.21%.Also of note, WTI crude lost 4.8% this week, entering bear market territory and extending its decline from last month's four-year high. U.S. President Donald Trump granted temporary wavers on Monday to eight countries who import oil from Iran after the U.S.'s energy sanctions on the OPEC member were officially reimposed.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants.  1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comCopyright (c) 2018 Comtex News Network, Inc.

The three companies are trading at 52-week highs, according to FactSet.Conversely, Apple (AAPL 195.74, -8.74) is the worst-performing Dow component after investors have presumed it to be the unnamed company in Lumentum's (LITE 39.44, -16.43) statement regarding its guidance cut.

Investors have presumed the unnamed customer to be Apple, as Apple accounted for 30% of LITE's fiscal 2018 net revenue and Lumentum's 3D sensing lasers are key components for the iPhone's Face ID technology.Consequently, weakness has trickled down to chip stocks, as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index bares a loss of 3.7%.

For the week, the S&P 500 advanced 2.1%.Outperforming the broader market on Friday were the defensive-oriented consumer staples (+0.5%), real estate (+0.1%), and utilities (+0.1%) sectors. Conversely, FANG stocks within the lagging communication services (-1.5%), consumer discretionary (-1.5%), and information technology (-1.7%) sectors underperformed.

Its guidance has extended a trend within the semiconductor industry that has warned of slowing chip demand. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index lost 1.9%.In other corporate news, Walt Disney (DIS 118.00, +2.00, +1.7%) rose after an upbeat earnings report, while General Electric (GE 8.58, -0.52, -5.7%) took a hit after JPMorgan cut its price target on the stock to $6 from $10. In response, the former Dow component responded that it is a ""fundamentally strong company with a sound liquidity position,"" according to a CNBC report.Demand for Treasuries increased amid the equity setback, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield lost four basis points to 2.93%, and the 10-yr yield lost five basis points to 3.19%. For the week, the 2-yr yield added two basis points, while the 10-yr yield shed two basis points.Separately, WTI crude, which is the U.S. benchmark for oil, fell 0.9% to settle at $60.16/bbl. Friday's loss has extended its decline to 21.8% from its Oct 3 four-year high. On a related note, the oil-sensitive energy sector lost 0.4% on Friday.In economic data, the Producer Price Index (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) for October was released on Friday morning, showing a higher-than-expected increase of 0.6%. The core reading, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy, also came in above consensus (+0.5% actual vs +0.2% Briefing.com consensus). The headline pressures stoked concerns about pass-through inflation to consumers and, in turn, helped to strengthen the Fed's case for additional rate hikes.In trade news, White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro made some combative comments against CEOs for pushing President Trump to make a trade deal with China and stated a trade deal will be on the president's terms. Separately, President Trump has reportedly been telling associates that he wants to replace Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross by the end of the year.Overseas, China reported just a 0.2% rise in its Consumer Price Index on Friday, which was in-line with estimates but significantly below last month's increase of 0.7%. Its softening inflation has continued to fuel concerns over a slowing Chinese economy.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for October, the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for November, and the Wholesale Inventories report for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand jumped 0.6% in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, less food and energy, rose 0.5% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). Those increases left the index for final demand up 2.9% year-over-year, versus 2.6% in September, and the index for final demand, less food and energy, up 2.6% year-over-year, versus 2.5% in September. The key takeaway from the report is that it will stoke concerns about pass-through inflation to the consumer, which have already been stoked by numerous companies during the third quarter earnings-reporting period talking about higher input costs and increasing prices. The preliminary University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for November held quite steady, edging down to 98.3 (Briefing.com consensus 98.0) from the final reading of 98.6 for October. The key takeaway from the report is that stock market sell-off in October had no real impact on consumer sentiment, which was rooted more in favorable views about income expectations and job growth that are key drivers of consumer spending. Wholesale inventories increased 0.4% in September (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) on top of a downwardly revised 0.9% increase (from 1.0%) in August. The key takeaway from the report is that sales are increasing year-over-year at a faster rate than inventories, which can be a precursor to improved pricing power for wholesalers.Looking ahead, investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +7.3% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average +5.1% YTD S&P 500 +4.0% YTD Russell 2000 +0.9% YTDWeek in Review: Fed Policy Statement Not Enough to Derail U.S. Midterm GainsThe S&P 500 rose 2.1% this week, but had to weather a late week sell-off after the latest policy statement from the Federal Reserve humbled an upbeat reaction to the midterm elections. Neither outcome was a surprise, but they were representative of recent market volatility. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite also finished the week higher, adding 2.8% and 0.7%, respectively. The Russell 2000 added 0.1%.The midterm elections produced a split Congress with the Democrats taking control of the House and the Republicans retaining control of the Senate. The prevailing assumption in the market was that a newly divided Congress would preserve market-friendly policies, namely the tax cut and deregulation efforts. In addition, investors took delight in the fact that the stock market has historically done well in years with a Republican president and split Congress.The Fed released its policy statement on Thursday, in which it decided to leave the fed funds rate unchanged as expected. The central bank noted that it expects further rate hikes that are consistent with sustained economic growth, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near its symmetric 2% target over the medium term, but omitted October's sell-off and U.S.-China trade developments from its policy statement. Those omissions were a clear, between-the-lines message that the FOMC remains poised to raise rates for a fourth time this year in December.In the stock market, the health care (+4.0%), real estate (+3.6%), and utility (+3.1%) groups led the way. Of note, health care has surpassed the information technology (+1.4%) and consumer discretionary (+2.0%) sectors for the top spot in the yearly sector standings with a 2018 gain of 12.4%. For comparison, tech is up 10.7%, and consumer discretionary is up 10.9%.Conversely, the communication services sector was the only group to finish in negative territory with a weekly loss of 0.2%.In earnings, some notable companies that had upbeat reports included Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), CVS (CVS), Eli Lilly (LLY), Humana (HUM), and Walt Disney (DIS). On the other hand, Skyworks Solution (SWKS) led chip stocks lower on Friday after it issued below-consensus Q1 earnings and revenue guidance. Skyworks, which is an Apple (AAPL) supplier, warned of slowing chip demand, continuing a disappointing trend out of the semiconductor industry.On a related note, Japan's Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple decided to cancel a production increase in its newest low-end iPhone XR. However, the Nikkei also said that demand for the older generation iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus has been higher than expected. Nevertheless, the report corroborated fears over the company reaching peak iPhone sales.In politics, Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned his post effective immediately per President Trump's request. Pot stocks initially surged in response to his resignation, as his adamant anti-marijuana stance has been seen as a roadblock to advancing the national discussion for legalization. However, pot stocks pulled back as replacement names currently being floated are against marijuana legalization; acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker has a mixed record on the issue.Looking at other markets, U.S. Treasuries had a volatile week, and closed near last week's levels. This week, the 2-yr yield decreased two basis points to 2.91%, and the 10-yr yield added two basis points to 3.21%.Also of note, WTI crude lost 4.8% this week, entering bear market territory and extending its decline from last month's four-year high. U.S. President Donald Trump granted temporary wavers on Monday to eight countries who import oil from Iran after the U.S.'s energy sanctions on the OPEC member were officially reimposed.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants.  1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comCopyright (c) 2018 Comtex News Network, Inc.

The three companies are trading at 52-week highs, according to FactSet.Conversely, Apple (AAPL 195.74, -8.74) is the worst-performing Dow component after investors have presumed it to be the unnamed company in Lumentum's (LITE 39.44, -16.43, -29.4%) statement regarding its guidance cut. Lumentum said one of its largest customers has asked for a reduction in 3D sensing lasers, which play an integral part in the iPhone's Face ID technology.With notable losses to start the trading week, the DJIA holds a gain of 1.5% in November.13:00 ETDow -452.96 at 25536.34, Nasdaq -166.34 at 7240.76, S&P -39.91 at 2741.24[BRIEFING.COM] The S&P 500, down 1.4%, is on pace for its third straight day of losses as Apple (AAPL 195.92, -8.54, -4.2%) and chipstocks weigh down the information technology sector (-2.9%) and the broader market.

Investors have presumed the unnamed customer to be Apple, as Apple accounted for 30% of LITE's fiscal 2018 net revenue and Lumentum's 3D sensing lasers are key components for the iPhone's Face ID technology.Consequently, weakness has trickled down to chip stocks, as the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index bares a loss of 3.7%.

For the week, the S&P 500 advanced 2.1%.Outperforming the broader market on Friday were the defensive-oriented consumer staples (+0.5%), real estate (+0.1%), and utilities (+0.1%) sectors. Conversely, FANG stocks within the lagging communication services (-1.5%), consumer discretionary (-1.5%), and information technology (-1.7%) sectors underperformed.

Its guidance has extended a trend within the semiconductor industry that has warned of slowing chip demand. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index lost 1.9%.In other corporate news, Walt Disney (DIS 118.00, +2.00, +1.7%) rose after an upbeat earnings report, while General Electric (GE 8.58, -0.52, -5.7%) took a hit after JPMorgan cut its price target on the stock to $6 from $10. In response, the former Dow component responded that it is a ""fundamentally strong company with a sound liquidity position,"" according to a CNBC report.Demand for Treasuries increased amid the equity setback, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield lost four basis points to 2.93%, and the 10-yr yield lost five basis points to 3.19%. For the week, the 2-yr yield added two basis points, while the 10-yr yield shed two basis points.Separately, WTI crude, which is the U.S. benchmark for oil, fell 0.9% to settle at $60.16/bbl. Friday's loss has extended its decline to 21.8% from its Oct 3 four-year high. On a related note, the oil-sensitive energy sector lost 0.4% on Friday.In economic data, the Producer Price Index (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) for October was released on Friday morning, showing a higher-than-expected increase of 0.6%. The core reading, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy, also came in above consensus (+0.5% actual vs +0.2% Briefing.com consensus). The headline pressures stoked concerns about pass-through inflation to consumers and, in turn, helped to strengthen the Fed's case for additional rate hikes.In trade news, White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro made some combative comments against CEOs for pushing President Trump to make a trade deal with China and stated a trade deal will be on the president's terms. Separately, President Trump has reportedly been telling associates that he wants to replace Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross by the end of the year.Overseas, China reported just a 0.2% rise in its Consumer Price Index on Friday, which was in-line with estimates but significantly below last month's increase of 0.7%. Its softening inflation has continued to fuel concerns over a slowing Chinese economy.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for October, the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for November, and the Wholesale Inventories report for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand jumped 0.6% in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, less food and energy, rose 0.5% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). Those increases left the index for final demand up 2.9% year-over-year, versus 2.6% in September, and the index for final demand, less food and energy, up 2.6% year-over-year, versus 2.5% in September. The key takeaway from the report is that it will stoke concerns about pass-through inflation to the consumer, which have already been stoked by numerous companies during the third quarter earnings-reporting period talking about higher input costs and increasing prices. The preliminary University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for November held quite steady, edging down to 98.3 (Briefing.com consensus 98.0) from the final reading of 98.6 for October. The key takeaway from the report is that stock market sell-off in October had no real impact on consumer sentiment, which was rooted more in favorable views about income expectations and job growth that are key drivers of consumer spending. Wholesale inventories increased 0.4% in September (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) on top of a downwardly revised 0.9% increase (from 1.0%) in August. The key takeaway from the report is that sales are increasing year-over-year at a faster rate than inventories, which can be a precursor to improved pricing power for wholesalers.Looking ahead, investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +7.3% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average +5.1% YTD S&P 500 +4.0% YTD Russell 2000 +0.9% YTDWeek in Review: Fed Policy Statement Not Enough to Derail U.S. Midterm GainsThe S&P 500 rose 2.1% this week, but had to weather a late week sell-off after the latest policy statement from the Federal Reserve humbled an upbeat reaction to the midterm elections. Neither outcome was a surprise, but they were representative of recent market volatility. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite also finished the week higher, adding 2.8% and 0.7%, respectively. The Russell 2000 added 0.1%.The midterm elections produced a split Congress with the Democrats taking control of the House and the Republicans retaining control of the Senate. The prevailing assumption in the market was that a newly divided Congress would preserve market-friendly policies, namely the tax cut and deregulation efforts. In addition, investors took delight in the fact that the stock market has historically done well in years with a Republican president and split Congress.The Fed released its policy statement on Thursday, in which it decided to leave the fed funds rate unchanged as expected. The central bank noted that it expects further rate hikes that are consistent with sustained economic growth, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near its symmetric 2% target over the medium term, but omitted October's sell-off and U.S.-China trade developments from its policy statement. Those omissions were a clear, between-the-lines message that the FOMC remains poised to raise rates for a fourth time this year in December.In the stock market, the health care (+4.0%), real estate (+3.6%), and utility (+3.1%) groups led the way. Of note, health care has surpassed the information technology (+1.4%) and consumer discretionary (+2.0%) sectors for the top spot in the yearly sector standings with a 2018 gain of 12.4%. For comparison, tech is up 10.7%, and consumer discretionary is up 10.9%.Conversely, the communication services sector was the only group to finish in negative territory with a weekly loss of 0.2%.In earnings, some notable companies that had upbeat reports included Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), CVS (CVS), Eli Lilly (LLY), Humana (HUM), and Walt Disney (DIS). On the other hand, Skyworks Solution (SWKS) led chip stocks lower on Friday after it issued below-consensus Q1 earnings and revenue guidance. Skyworks, which is an Apple (AAPL) supplier, warned of slowing chip demand, continuing a disappointing trend out of the semiconductor industry.On a related note, Japan's Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple decided to cancel a production increase in its newest low-end iPhone XR. However, the Nikkei also said that demand for the older generation iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus has been higher than expected. Nevertheless, the report corroborated fears over the company reaching peak iPhone sales.In politics, Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned his post effective immediately per President Trump's request. Pot stocks initially surged in response to his resignation, as his adamant anti-marijuana stance has been seen as a roadblock to advancing the national discussion for legalization. However, pot stocks pulled back as replacement names currently being floated are against marijuana legalization; acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker has a mixed record on the issue.Looking at other markets, U.S. Treasuries had a volatile week, and closed near last week's levels. This week, the 2-yr yield decreased two basis points to 2.91%, and the 10-yr yield added two basis points to 3.21%.Also of note, WTI crude lost 4.8% this week, entering bear market territory and extending its decline from last month's four-year high. U.S. President Donald Trump granted temporary wavers on Monday to eight countries who import oil from Iran after the U.S.'s energy sanctions on the OPEC member were officially reimposed.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants.  1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comCopyright (c) 2018 Comtex News Network, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8%, the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.7%, and the Russell 2000 lost 1.8%. For the week, the S&P 500 advanced 2.1%.Outperforming the broader market on Friday were the defensive-oriented consumer staples (+0.5%), real estate (+0.1%), and utilities (+0.1%) sectors. Conversely, FANG stocks within the lagging communication services (-1.5%), consumer discretionary (-1.5%), and information technology (-1.7%) sectors underperformed.

Its guidance has extended a trend within the semiconductor industry that has warned of slowing chip demand. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index lost 1.9%.In other corporate news, Walt Disney (DIS 118.00, +2.00, +1.7%) rose after an upbeat earnings report, while General Electric (GE 8.58, -0.52, -5.7%) took a hit after JPMorgan cut its price target on the stock to $6 from $10. In response, the former Dow component responded that it is a ""fundamentally strong company with a sound liquidity position,"" according to a CNBC report.Demand for Treasuries increased amid the equity setback, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield lost four basis points to 2.93%, and the 10-yr yield lost five basis points to 3.19%. For the week, the 2-yr yield added two basis points, while the 10-yr yield shed two basis points.Separately, WTI crude, which is the U.S. benchmark for oil, fell 0.9% to settle at $60.16/bbl. Friday's loss has extended its decline to 21.8% from its Oct 3 four-year high. On a related note, the oil-sensitive energy sector lost 0.4% on Friday.In economic data, the Producer Price Index (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) for October was released on Friday morning, showing a higher-than-expected increase of 0.6%. The core reading, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy, also came in above consensus (+0.5% actual vs +0.2% Briefing.com consensus). The headline pressures stoked concerns about pass-through inflation to consumers and, in turn, helped to strengthen the Fed's case for additional rate hikes.In trade news, White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro made some combative comments against CEOs for pushing President Trump to make a trade deal with China and stated a trade deal will be on the president's terms. Separately, President Trump has reportedly been telling associates that he wants to replace Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross by the end of the year.Overseas, China reported just a 0.2% rise in its Consumer Price Index on Friday, which was in-line with estimates but significantly below last month's increase of 0.7%. Its softening inflation has continued to fuel concerns over a slowing Chinese economy.Reviewing Friday's economic data, which included the Producer Price Index for October, the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for November, and the Wholesale Inventories report for September:The Producer Price Index for final demand jumped 0.6% in October (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the index for final demand, less food and energy, rose 0.5% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%). Those increases left the index for final demand up 2.9% year-over-year, versus 2.6% in September, and the index for final demand, less food and energy, up 2.6% year-over-year, versus 2.5% in September. The key takeaway from the report is that it will stoke concerns about pass-through inflation to the consumer, which have already been stoked by numerous companies during the third quarter earnings-reporting period talking about higher input costs and increasing prices. The preliminary University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for November held quite steady, edging down to 98.3 (Briefing.com consensus 98.0) from the final reading of 98.6 for October. The key takeaway from the report is that stock market sell-off in October had no real impact on consumer sentiment, which was rooted more in favorable views about income expectations and job growth that are key drivers of consumer spending. Wholesale inventories increased 0.4% in September (Briefing.com consensus 0.3%) on top of a downwardly revised 0.9% increase (from 1.0%) in August. The key takeaway from the report is that sales are increasing year-over-year at a faster rate than inventories, which can be a precursor to improved pricing power for wholesalers.Looking ahead, investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.Nasdaq Composite +7.3% YTD Dow Jones Industrial Average +5.1% YTD S&P 500 +4.0% YTD Russell 2000 +0.9% YTDWeek in Review: Fed Policy Statement Not Enough to Derail U.S. Midterm GainsThe S&P 500 rose 2.1% this week, but had to weather a late week sell-off after the latest policy statement from the Federal Reserve humbled an upbeat reaction to the midterm elections. Neither outcome was a surprise, but they were representative of recent market volatility. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite also finished the week higher, adding 2.8% and 0.7%, respectively. The Russell 2000 added 0.1%.The midterm elections produced a split Congress with the Democrats taking control of the House and the Republicans retaining control of the Senate. The prevailing assumption in the market was that a newly divided Congress would preserve market-friendly policies, namely the tax cut and deregulation efforts. In addition, investors took delight in the fact that the stock market has historically done well in years with a Republican president and split Congress.The Fed released its policy statement on Thursday, in which it decided to leave the fed funds rate unchanged as expected. The central bank noted that it expects further rate hikes that are consistent with sustained economic growth, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near its symmetric 2% target over the medium term, but omitted October's sell-off and U.S.-China trade developments from its policy statement. Those omissions were a clear, between-the-lines message that the FOMC remains poised to raise rates for a fourth time this year in December.In the stock market, the health care (+4.0%), real estate (+3.6%), and utility (+3.1%) groups led the way. Of note, health care has surpassed the information technology (+1.4%) and consumer discretionary (+2.0%) sectors for the top spot in the yearly sector standings with a 2018 gain of 12.4%. For comparison, tech is up 10.7%, and consumer discretionary is up 10.9%.Conversely, the communication services sector was the only group to finish in negative territory with a weekly loss of 0.2%.In earnings, some notable companies that had upbeat reports included Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), CVS (CVS), Eli Lilly (LLY), Humana (HUM), and Walt Disney (DIS). On the other hand, Skyworks Solution (SWKS) led chip stocks lower on Friday after it issued below-consensus Q1 earnings and revenue guidance. Skyworks, which is an Apple (AAPL) supplier, warned of slowing chip demand, continuing a disappointing trend out of the semiconductor industry.On a related note, Japan's Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple decided to cancel a production increase in its newest low-end iPhone XR. However, the Nikkei also said that demand for the older generation iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus has been higher than expected. Nevertheless, the report corroborated fears over the company reaching peak iPhone sales.In politics, Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned his post effective immediately per President Trump's request. Pot stocks initially surged in response to his resignation, as his adamant anti-marijuana stance has been seen as a roadblock to advancing the national discussion for legalization. However, pot stocks pulled back as replacement names currently being floated are against marijuana legalization; acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker has a mixed record on the issue.Looking at other markets, U.S. Treasuries had a volatile week, and closed near last week's levels. This week, the 2-yr yield decreased two basis points to 2.91%, and the 10-yr yield added two basis points to 3.21%.Also of note, WTI crude lost 4.8% this week, entering bear market territory and extending its decline from last month's four-year high. U.S. President Donald Trump granted temporary wavers on Monday to eight countries who import oil from Iran after the U.S.'s energy sanctions on the OPEC member were officially reimposed.Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants.  1-800-752-3013 or http://www.briefing.comCopyright (c) 2018 Comtex News Network, Inc.

2018-11-08 09:47:05.000,2018-11-08 09:47:05+00:00,Japan's Sumitomo Metal cuts FY profit forecast on lower metal prices,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20181108:nL4N1XJ3WB:3,NS:RTRS,".storyContent * {border-color:inherit !important;outline-color:inherit !important;}TOKYO, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Japan's Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd 5713.T posted a 52 percent jump in half-yearly pre-tax profit on Thursday but cut its full-year forecast, blaming lower-than-expected metal prices amid the U.S.-Sino trade spat, and reduced nickel output.""It doesn't seem that there will be a quick settlement in the U.S.-China trade conflicts, which suggests no quick recovery in prices of metals,"" Kunihiko Miyamoto, deputy manager of Sumitomo Metal Mining, told a news conference.Pre-tax profit rose to 73.21 billion yen ($644 million) for the six months through September, bolstered by increases in prices of copper, nickel and cobalt from a year earlier, and a one-off gain from the sale of its stake in Pogo gold mine in Alaska.  (Full Story)But the Japanese miner and smelter slashed its pre-tax profit prediction for the year to March 31 to 107 billion yen from its May guidance of 121 billion yen as it lowered its assumed prices of metals such as copper and nickel. The revised figure missed a consensus estimate of 138.1 billion yen in a poll of 11 analysts by Refinitiv. Sumitomo Metal now expects an average copper price of $6,294 per tonne for the current financial year, against its May estimate of $6,500, and nickel price $5.89 per pound against its earlier forecast of $6.The company said boiler and other system troubles at its Taganito nickel ore processing plant in the Philippines earlier this year reduced its refined nickel output to 28,200 tonnes from 30,967 tonnes a year earlier.""We missed to fully benefit from higher metal prices in the first six months due to lower production of nickel,"" Miyamoto said.The company also trimmed its annual dividend forecast to 89 yen per share from its May estimate of 103 yen as it cut its profit forecast.Sumitomo Metal has made a series of investments over the past four years to boost capacity of the nickel-cobalt-aluminium (NCA) cathode materials used in Panasonic Corp's 6752.T lithium-ion battery that powers Tesla Inc's TSLA.O Model 3 and Model X.  (Full Story)Sumitomo Metal's estimated profit from materials businesses for the year is unchanged from its May estimate, the company said.

2018-11-05 21:31:04.959,2018-11-05 21:31:04.959000+00:00,US stocks rise as banks and health care companies climb,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20181105:nNRA7aai1y:1,NS:ASSOPR,".storyContent * {border-color:inherit !important;outline-color:inherit !important;}NEW YORKNEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks mostly rose Monday as financial and health care companies finished higher, while Apple and other technology companies continued to fall. Asian indexes fell following weak economic data in China and a lack of progress in trade negotiations between the U.S. and China.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which owns Geico and other insurance businesses, led the rally in financial stocks after it reported strong results over the weekend. Drugmakers including Eli Lilly also climbed. Apple took another sharp loss, which knocked the tech giant's market value below the $1 trillion mark.Real estate companies, utilities, and other high-dividend stocks finished with solid gains as high-growth stocks like tech and internet companies slipped. Smaller and more U.S.-focused companies also lagged.Big technology companies and small companies were both hit hard during the market's slump in October. Tech companies fell as investors worried about the trade dispute and about an increase in interest rates, which could erode their future profits. Smaller companies are vulnerable to higher interest rates because they tend to carry more debt.Earnings for S&P 500 companies are on track to grow about 20 percent this year, and analysts expect company profits to grow another 10 percent next year, according to FactSet. But Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for the Leuthold Group, said that might be too optimistic because costs and interest rates are rising and global economic growth could slip.""It's a double whammy of slowing sales at the same time we may be starting to (see pressure on) profit margins,"" he said. Paulsen said corporate earnings could fall next year, and smaller companies might have a hard time dealing with that.""Large companies tend to operate with bigger profit margins, and they have more room as a result of that to allow them to cut and to deal with a slowdown,"" he said.The S&P 500 index added 15.25 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,738.31. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 190.87 points, or 0.8 percent, to 25,461.70.The Nasdaq composite sank 28.14 points, or 0.4 percent, to 7,328.85. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks slipped 0.47 point to 1,547.51.Stocks plunged in October, but last week was the market's best week since March. One reason for that recovery was increased optimism about trade talks, as Chinese officials and President Donald Trump said a phone conversation between Trump and China's President Xi Jinping had gone well. On Monday Xi promised to reduce costs for importers and raise consumer spending power, but he did not address the technology policy dispute between the U.S. and China, a critical part of the trade impasse.Berkshire Hathaway said its profit quadrupled in the third quarter as the value of its investments climbed. It also reported better results from its insurance and railroad divisions. Berkshire bought back almost $1 billion in stock during the quarter, the most in years. Its Class B stock climbed 4.7 percent to $216.24. Other insurers and banks also rose.Apple lost another 2.8 percent to $201.59. The stock tumbled Friday following a weak fourth-quarter forecast. Apple also said it will stop announcing how many iPhones it sold each quarter. Daniel Ives of Wedbush said that while Apple's announcement felt ""flippant,"" it's actually part of a strategy intended to get investors to see the company as a services provider and not just a device seller.In early August Apple became the first publicly traded company valued at $1 trillion, but Monday's decline brought its value down to $958.6 billion.After big gains late last week, Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 1.5 percent and South Korea's Kospi dropped 0.9 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 2.1 percent.Benchmark U.S. crude slipped 0.1 percent to $63.10 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 0.5 percent to $73.17 per barrel in London.Natural gas soared 8.6 percent to $3.57 per 1,000 cubic feet following forecasts for cold weather in the next few days. According to the Energy Department, nearly half of all U.S. households use natural gas as the primary source for heating. Its price often surges when investors expect a cold snap. Heating oil also rose 1.1 percent to $2.20 a gallon.Wholesale gasoline lost 1 percent to $1.69 a gallon.Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.1 percent while Germany's DAZ fell 0.2 percent.

Markets had earlier climbed on hopes that the world's two biggest economies were mending their shaky trade relations.

It was up 2.3 percent on the week, clawing back some of the ground lost in October, its worst month in nearly two years as concerns about Brexit, Italy's budget, rising U.S. interest rates and slowing corporate earnings growth spooked investors.On Friday defensive stocks, which held up relatively robustly compared with cyclicals and growth sector during the October sell-off, were out of favour, providing the most pressure on the blue chip index.""Given the surge over the past week in equities, and the looming weekend, traders were always likely to be hunting for a reason to cut back on exposure at the end of the week, and so it has proved,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.""The drop has put a dent, but not a fatal one, into the current move higher.""Imperial Brands IMB.L lost 2.8 percent, British American Tobacco sank 2.3 percent and GlaxoSmithKline GSK.L fell 2.2 percent for its worst day in months.Most macro focus remained on hopes of a Brexit deal and signals from the Bank of England that if the exit from the European Union is smooth, more interest rate hikes could be on the way. Investors were also cautious ahead of the U.S. Midterm elections on Tuesday.But a Bloomberg report that U.S. President Donald Trump wants to reach an agreement with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Argentina later this month drew most attention on Friday.

It was up 4 percent.JPMorgan Chinese Investment Trust JMC.L was one of the biggest gainers on the small caps with a 9-percent rally for its best day in nearly 20 years. In late October, the shares hit their lowest since May last year.Boardroom news drew focus elsewhere on the FTSE 100. Sage Group SGE.L rallied 3 percent as investors welcomed news the software company's finance chief Steve Hare will take over as chief executive.

In a copy of a speech to be delivered at a conference in Melbourne on Tuesday, CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques said pushing the industry forward calls for ""a brand new spirit of partnership"".""New forms of partnering won't be just about governments, society and communities. It will also be about partnerships with customers, suppliers and even, competitors,"" he will say. He flagged in the speech Rio's ties with Apple - with which, together with Alcoa, it announced a partnership to make emissions-free aluminium in May - as ""an example of competitors working together to advance the future"".Partnerships could also help companies secure breakthroughs such as self-steering ships to transport materials, Jacques said, adding the technology may not be far off. Rio Tinto is already using massive driverless trains to transport iron ore in the Pilbara region of Australia, which it says can deliver efficiencies as well as improving safety. The project has however been years in the making and suffered delays.  (Full Story)Jacques said mining had an image problem as ""one of the least trusted on the planet"". As digitalisation takes hold, it needs to compete with technology giants, as well as other miners, to win talent.Investor trust was eroded during the commodity boom years when miners overspent on projects that may never deliver shareholder returns.  (Full Story)Institutional investors, which focus on environmental, social and governance issues, have also been made cautious by the exposure of miners to fossil fuel and by corruption allegations.Rio Tinto has previously pushed the idea that partnerships can enhance rather than dilute value and could help to fend off a rising tide of resource nationalism as some governments seek a bigger share of profits from mining.  (Full Story)  (Full Story) ""If a community or government wants a bigger share of the pie, they may need to be willing to take on more of the risk,"" Jacques said, according to the copy of the speech.""As an industry, perhaps, it is time to think about a different business model – where we provide mining as a service and let other people finance projects that need billions in upfront investment before the benefits can be shared.""

We think that the biggest factor is that oil is a DM centric commodity while metals are tightly linked to the investment cycle in EMs. While DM and EM cycles were highly correlated pre-crises more recently they have been getting increasingly disconnected.

Internet and health care companies rose while mining companies fell with metals prices.Apple and Amazon are the two most valuable U.S. companies, and analysts said each stock should keep climbing. Other market favorites including Facebook and Google parent Alphabet also rose.Interest rates slipped for a second day, which led to losses for banks, while the stronger dollar weighed on metals prices and on shares of the companies that mine those metals. Smaller companies, which have struggled in September, also fell.Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said investors have been reluctant to get back into the stock market since the 2008-09 recession, and there are signs that's changing.""Retail investors have been underinvested for this whole expansion,"" he said.

China rejected the charge. Investors brace for final U.S. GDP figures. Comcast says it will stop buying Sky's shares in the market after it secured 38 percent of the stock plus the 39 percent holding from Rupert Murdoch in the $40 billion takeover.Short Link: https://reut.rs/2N8hGWZVideo Transcript:Good morning, I am Angeline Ong and this is your US morning call. Wall Street looks set for a muted open as investors take stock of how long the Fed might continue to raise interest rates. The Dow Jones, the S&P, and the NASDAQ futures are treading water as you can see there. Actually, the NASDAQ futures up a bit more than the other two. The Fed on Wednesday stuck to its script, hiking borrowing costs and affirm plans for more policy tightening through to 2020. Meanwhile, it's all turned very nasty this week between China and the US with the latest accusations from President Trump, suggesting China is tampering with the midterm election. Is it all part of the negotiating tactic or could this be damaging? Earlier, we asked Redmayne-Bentley's head of investment management James Andrews. <br/><br/>Trump's known exponent of the art of the deal, the bully boy tactics whereby going in very strongly, or the view to a slight retrenchment to ultimately get to where he wanted to get to in the first place. He sees the fact that they have this large deficit with China as in you know, the US buys more goods from China than China does from it, meaning that they have the upper hand that China is more reliant on export into the US than the US is on China. But what China and the EU, to a certain extent also did with their tariffs that they imposed, they focused those tariffs, rather than being broad-based, they focused them on where it might well hurt Donald Trump in the midterms.<br/><br/>Facebook's unveiled its new virtual reality headset called Oculus Quest. Now this headset, which comes with touch controllers, does not need a PC to work. The price tag, well, this will set you back $399 and you'll be able to choose from plenty of games too as the company plans to launch more than 50 games for it. Now, Comcast will stop buying Sky shares in the market. This is after it's secured 38% of the stock, plus the 39% holding from Rupert Murdoch in the $40 billion takeover. In M&A, Indonesia is planning to hold a news conference linked to a $3.9 billion share purchase deal involving Freeport-<br/>McMoRan, Rio Tinto, and state miner INALUM. US mining giant Freeport agreed on a price and structure for the sale of a majority stake in the world's second biggest copper mine to the Indonesian government. The purpose of the ceremony though is still unclear. Well let's take a look at some other stocks to watch then and Bed, Bath, and Beyond shares could be set to open below an 18-year low. Q2 profit margins were bigger-than-expected, forcing the company to slash its full-year forecasts. Also checking in on Accenture shares, Q4 sales and profit beat Wall Street estimates as investments in its fast-growing digital and cloud services businesses paid off. <br/><br/>Later on, watch out for final GDP figures. Now no change expected and it's likely to show that US GDP grew at a 4.2% annualized rate, according to our Reuters poll. If this is the case or it is revised upwards, it would suggest that the US economy is on track to hit Trump's goal of 3% annual growth. And that's today's morning call. I'm Angeline Ong and this is Reuters.<br/>(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2018. Click For Restrictions - http://about.reuters.com/fulllegal.asp"

2018-09-20 05:07:23.783,2018-09-20 05:07:23.783000+00:00,Household Appliances Outlook: Costs a Bump on Growth Path,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20180920:nNRA6yz4pg:1,NS:ZACKSC,".storyContent * {border-color:inherit !important;outline-color:inherit !important;}Sep 19, 2018In an era of automation, technological advancements in smart household appliances, including voice-activated devices, have been playing a significant role. In addition, demand for fast-accessible and remotely-monitored home appliances has been consistently increasing, courtesy of tech-savvy consumers.Notably, analysts expect the Global Home Appliances Market to reach $203.37 billion by the end of 2023, a CAGR of 2.6% over the 2018-2023 time periods. The upside is likely to be backed by higher disposable income, rising per capita income, improving housing and construction activities, and the availability of home appliances at competitive prices.While the above mentioned factors speak volumes of the household appliances industry, higher raw material costs remain one of the major deterrents. Evidently, volatility in the prices of raw materials, including steel, oil, plastic, resin, aluminum, copper, zinc and nickel, have been weighing on the operating performances of key players in this space.Notably, volatile steel and resin costs have been significantly increasing the input costs of home appliances manufacturers likeWhirlpool(WHR) andElectrolux(ELUXY). This has been resulting in weak margins for these companies over the last few quarters.Higher tariff on steel, which forms a key raw material, due to the global trade war is an added concern. Earlier this year, the Trump administration had imposed a respective 25% and 10% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from China.Industry Lags on Shareholder ReturnsRaw material price inflation, unit-volume declines and unfavorable currency translations have been adversely impacting performance of key players in the industry. Additionally, increased tariffs on steel and aluminum resulting in higher input costs have largely dampened investors' confidence for the industry's near-term prospects.In a year's time, the Zacks Household Appliances Industry within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector has underperformed both the S&amp;P 500 and its own sector.     While the stocks in this industry have collectively plunged 35.1%, the Zacks S&amp;P 500 Composite and Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector have rallied 17.9% and 10.6%, respectively.One-Year Price Performance However, it's worth mentioning that there was a significant lack of synchronization in the performance of individual stocks within the group. While some Household Appliances stocks are suffering due to high raw material costs, others with a strong brand portfolio and strategic initiatives like cost-containment efforts, and product innovations and launches are able to stabilize their revenue graphs, leading to impressive performance. Nevertheless, industry concerns owing to higher costs are likely to weigh on margins.Household Appliances Stocks Trading CheapThanks to the underperformance of the industry over the past year, the valuation looks really cheap now. One might get a good sense of the industry's relative valuation by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which is the most appropriate multiple for valuing Consumer Discretionary stocks.    This ratio essentially measures a stock's current market value relative to its earnings performance. Investors believe that the lower the P/E, the higher the value of the stock will be.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 8.9, which is below its median level of 10.6 and the high level of 13.7 witnessed in a year, thus having significant upside potential.The space also looks inexpensive when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/E ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is 20 and the median level is 20.1.Price-to-Earnings Ratio (TTM)  Increased raw material price inflation along with higher tariffs imposed on steel and aluminium resulting in higher input costs are weighing on the operational performance of the Household Appliances stocks. These factors are likely to dent the financial performances of the various companies in the near term.But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. While the above ratio analysis shows that there is a solid value-oriented path ahead, one should not really consider the current price levels as good entry points unless there are convincing reasons to predict a rebound in the near term.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry's prospects of solid price performance is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, a reflection of the earnings revisions trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.One could get a good sense of a company's earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with the last year's reported number, but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates.The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Household Appliances industry is pegged at a loss of $12.07 per share, implying a significant decline since September 2017.Price and Consensus: Zacks Household Appliances Industry  Looking at the aggregate estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group's earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised down since Sep 30, 2017.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group's Zacks Industry Rank , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Household Appliances industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #110, which places it at the top 43% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Household Appliances Space: Earnings &amp; Revenue TrendsThe past earnings trend of the Household Appliances space as a whole reveals that the group has been witnessing a downtrend since 2016, prior to which it was up for about two years.Household Appliances EPS    Similarly, the top-line performance of the industry has been witnessing a downtrend since 2015.Household Appliances Revenues Bottom LineWhile sound economic prospects, including strong consumer spending and higher disposable income may boost demand for home appliances, increased raw material expenses can be a potent threat as it may increase prices of goods. Further, the earnings and revenue graphs of the Household Appliances industry have witnessed a persistent downtrend, signaling a gloomy long-term picture.Nevertheless, a positive Zacks Rank for the industry indicates bright near-term prospects. Also, the players in the space are focusing on product innovations and technological advancements to bring latest developments in household appliances, better interpret customers' requirements and cater to their demands efficiently. Moreover, cost containment efforts might help in cutting down rising raw material costs and boost margins.While none of the stocks in our Household Appliances industry currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), there are two stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .Libbey Inc.(LBY): This Toledo, OH-based producer of glass tableware in the U.S. and Canada has gained 11.7% in the past year and has a Zacks Rank of 2.

We expect refined tin output to contract in the second half of 2018,"" Metal Bulletin analyst Boris Mikanikrezai said.The continued decline in inventories also lent upward support to tin prices, indicating positive demand.Tin stocks on the London Metal Exchange declined by 15 tonnes to 2,685 tonnes on September 20 - they are down 70 tonnes so far in September after falling by 70 tonnes in August.Strong demand from the semiconductor industry has also contributed to the bullish sentiment.""The demand profile for refined tin is steady and positive, thanks to robust growth in the semiconductor industry. Semiconductor sales (50% of global refined tin consumption) totaled $39.5 billion in July (up 0.5% month on month and up 17.4% year on year) and $265.8 billion in the first seven months of the year (an increase of 20.2% year on year), according to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). This comes after growth of 21.6% in 2017. We forecast refined tin demand growth at 1.5% this year,"" Mikanikrezai said.Nickel has been the worst performer of the complex so far this morning, with more metal flowing into China following the opening of the import window amid moderate consumption.The most-traded SHFE November nickel contract had edged down 490 yuan to 102,850 yuan per tonne as of 9.59am Shanghai time.Metal Bulletin assessed nickel stocks in Shanghai-bonded warehouses stood at 47,000-54,000 tonnes on August 31, compared with 44,000-51,000 tonnes a month earlier, according to Metal Bulletin's latest assessment.""The ferro-nickel and stainless steel markets are expected to remain stable following the China National Day holiday (October 1-7); although the market is positive about future nickel consumption in the electric vehicle industry, the rise in nickel demand is still only in theory,"" Guotai Junan Futures said.Other base metals move higher, bar copper  Currency moves and data releases   The SHFE November copper contract price dropped 190 yuan to 49,450 yuan per tonne.The SHFE November aluminium contract price rose 20 yuan to 14,555 yuan per tonne.The SHFE November zinc contract price was up 90 yuan to 21,675 yuan per tonne.The SHFE November lead contract price gained 5 yuan to 18,485 yuan per tonne.The dollar index was down 0.09% at 94.48 as of 9.51am Shanghai time.In other commodities, the Brent crude oil spot price was up 0.39% to $79.6 per barrel as of 9.51am Shanghai time.In equities, the Shanghai Composite was up by 0.07% to 2,732.85 at 10.52am Shanghai time.In US data yesterday, building permits stood at 1.23 million, below the forecast of 1.31 million. Housing starts exceeded estimates with a 1.28 million reading, while the current account stood at -$101 billion.Today's economic calendar is light, with US inflation rate of note.The spotlight will be on the press conference by the European Central Bank and Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) member Randal Quarles' testimony.
